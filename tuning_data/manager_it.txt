[reads] my speech is entitled \"ginger kids: children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.\" [stan and kyle glance at each other] we`ve all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. i`m talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. a red-headed boy appears] aww sick! gross! ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] aw, nasty! yuck! [returns to his paper] this disease is called gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.\nkyle: [annoyed at cartman`s ignorance] what?!\ncartman: kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] ah sick! [another redhead] gross! [another redhead] yeck! [returns to his paper] because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires.\nclass: aaaah.\nkyle: that`s not true, fatass! i have red hair, and i don`t have to avoid the sun!\ncartman: i was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. these people are called \"daywalkers.\" [cues up a picture of kyle, with \"daywalkers\" written underneath]\nbutters: oh! daywalkers!\nkyle: this is all a bunch of crap!\ncartman: mrs. garrison, i`m really havin` a difficult time with all these interruptions.\nmrs. garrison: kyle, let eric give his presentation.\nkyle: it`s not a presentation, it`s a hate speech! people aren`t creeped out by gingers!\nclyde: [glances around] i am.\nmrs. garrison: kyle, if you wanna debate eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!\nkyle: fine, i will! [crosses his arms]\ncartman: fine! in the meantime, shut your goddamned daywalker mouth! [kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] let`s see, where was i? oh yes! like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. it is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. in conclusion, i will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of carrot top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]\nkyle: stupid supremacist asswipe!\nstan: dude, what`s the big deal?\nkyle: what`s the big deal? don`t you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? i have to disprove cartman`s hateful rumors! do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?\nstan: [thinks a moment] what about the foley family? i think they`re all ginger.\n<scene>: south park, day. stan and kyle walk up to a house. the front door opens and three redheads greet them.\nthree kids: hello?\nkyle: hey. wuh i`m giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. can i ask you a few questions?\ngirl: [the middle child] sure. come on in.
