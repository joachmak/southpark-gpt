[stan moves on down the sidewalk and passes a scientology center. in front are a table with two people seated behind it, waiting for prospects]\nwoman: hello, would you like to take a personality test? it`s fun and it`s free.\nstan: [stops, thinks, and looks] excuse me?\nwoman: we`re doing free personality tests today.\nstan: uh what do i have to do?\nwoman: have you heard of scientology? it`s all based on the book, dianetics. a lot of really cool people are scientologists, like tom cruise and john travolta. why don`t you come on in and we`ll get your fun free personality test started. [leads him in and walks by one closed door after another] let`s just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today. [finds an open door and looks in] hey brian.\nbrian: [seated at his desk, rises and walks to the door] hey kelly. how`s it going?\nkelly: great! i want you to meet my new friend, stan.\nbrian: hey there! how are you?\nstan: fine.\nkelly: brian`s gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about scientology.\nbrian: good times, good times!\nstan: l-look, is this a religion? because my family is like, catholic or something.\nbrian: ho, that`s not a problem at all. scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.\nstan: then how come that sign says \"church of scientology\"?\nbrian: oho, that`s just this thing: what`s the denver broncos` record now? six and two?\nstan: seven and two.\nbrian: wow! that`s great! all right, come on in and take a seat; we`re gonna have some fun! [he and stam enter the room and he changes the sign on his door so it says \"test in progress.\" inside, brian and stan take their seats] all right now, i`m just gonna ask you a few questions. just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright? [picks up a notepad and starts noting stan`s answers] okay. number 1: do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?\nstan: uhhh, sh-sure?\nbrian: uh huh. would you rather give orders... than take them?\nstan: yeah?\nbrian: do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it. [the wall clock reads 11:35, then 12:20, and the camera pans down to brian and stan.] okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?\nstan: yes.\nbrian: okay, stan. well, that`s it. that`s the end of the personality test."},{"role":"assistant","content":"stan"}]}
