[kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]\nstan: that`s not true. you can`t get high off of cat urine, can you?\nmr. mackey: well, it`s a it`s not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they`re marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. m`kay? re-really reeeally high. okay? [kenny is trying really hard to choke himself] probably shou-shouldn`t have told you that just now. hm`kay? tha, that was probably bad.\n<scene>: cartman`s house, day. the original four boys are there, gathered around the coffee table on which stands a frame holding a cat in a harness. cartman is almost done with the cat\ncartman: all right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. [mr. kitty meows] yesss, poor mr. kitty, are you just so upset right now? [mr. kitty meows]\nkyle: you guys are wasting your time.\nstan: yeah, this is not gonna work.\ncartman: okay, ready kenny?\nkenny: (all set.)\ncartman: all right, bring out...! the other male cat. [kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite mr. kitty. the two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. after a short while, mr. kitty shoots concentrated piss into kenny`s face]\nkenny: (woah.)\nkyle: whoa! [kenny staggers backwards. the other guys gather round him]\nstan: do you feel anything?\ncartman: well, kenny? are you buzzed? [kenny`s not responding. his mind is elsewhere...]\n<scene>: kenny`s eyes are unfocused as his mind goes into an altered state. he seems to be going through space, then an acid trip, then both. kenny descends into a thunderbird fitted with rocket boosters and takes the wheel. he heads towards a desert planet and lands with a thud. he quickly shifts gears and peels away. he drives through the desert landscape until a curvaceous woman steps into his path. he stops. she wears a stylized cowboy hat and skimpy clothes. kenny motions over and lets her take the wheel. kenny can`t help but look at her breasts. they head towards a huge building with breast-shaped touches all overs. the woman steps out and walks towards the stairs, then enters the building. kenny quickly follows suit. as they walk through the building a creature stabs another one through the skull, killing him\nkenny: (hey cool! check it out!)\nfather: i see that you`re enticed by my daughter`s awesome rocking tits.\nkenny: (yeahhh!)\nfather: then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of varnov. appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.\nkenny: (okay!) [follows her towards the fountain. at the fountain`s edge, she undresses, then he begins to undress] (woop! woo-hoo!)\ncartman: [through kenny`s hallucination] kenny! kenny, wake up! [in the middle of town, cartman is stopping kenny from disrobing any further] wake up, kenny! you all right? kenny!\nkenny: (what?) [opens his eyes and looks around] (where`d she go?) [stands up and pulls up his pants.]\ncartman: dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. you were seriously tripping balls.\nkenny: (you fucking asshole!)\ncartman: agh, kenny! knock it off! what`s wrong with you?\nkenny: [punching cartman] (what the fuck did you do that for?)\ncartman: ah, kenny! [stan and kyle come up to restrain kenny]\nkyle: dude! dude, kenny, calm down!\nkenny: [walks away from them a bit, mad] (aww i was so close! you should have seen her titties.)\nstan: what titties?\nkenny: [turns around] (the titties! oh my god, they were incredible!)\nkyle: kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering."},{"role":"assistant","content":"yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes."}]}
