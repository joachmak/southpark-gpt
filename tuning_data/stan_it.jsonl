[strokes his chin]\n<scene>: montage: cartman tries out his suit in front of a full-length mirror in his room. stan and kyle try out suits in kyle`s room. next, the boys are in a department store purchasing cell phones at bull`s eye. next, stan and kyle carry an executive desk into the new office. next, cartman and kenny steal a fountain from somebody`s backyard. next, flyers for the new agency, super awesome talent agency, are printed out. next, the boys are at a copy center to get some business cards. next, cartman and kyle set up signs around town. next, the finished office is shown... in cartman`s basement. the four boys congratulate each other for a job well done.\n<scene>: south park, day. tolkien walks by one of the signs the boys drew up. he notices it and stops to read it. the boys hide around the corner. stan peaks around the corner.\nstan: he`s looking at the sign.\ncartman: perfect! all right, you guys get back to the office, i`ll bring tolkien there.\nstan: all right.\ncartman: wait a minute! you guys, this is very important: when i bring tolkien back to the office, have kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.\nkyle: why?\ncartman: because i`ll answer and pretend i`m talking to somebody super famous and important. when tolkien sees that, maybe he`ll think we`re legit.\nstan: it`s genius.\ncartman: [motioning them away] okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into tolkien`s field of view talking into his cell phone] yeah? well then tell him we`re just not interested. [stops just before they collide] oh hey, tolkien! buddy, my man, what is up?!\ntolkien: nothin`\ncartman: [puts his phone away] hey, you know, i heard you were doing something down in denver tomorrow night.\ntolkien: yeah.\ncartman: yeah i don`t know if i ever told you this before, but i`m actually an agent over at the super awesome talent agency. you may have seen our ads around town. anyway, why don`t you come down to the office, tolkien? maybe i can convince the company to represent you.\ntolkien: i`m supposed to be home by 3:30.\ncartman: this will only take a second.\n<scene>: cartman`s basement - er, super awesome talent agency. cartman takes tolkien down the stairs and onto the agency floor\ncartman: welcome to our offices, tolkien. as you can see, we are quite a successful company. did you notice the fountain? pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then cartman turns tolkien around] come on over this way, tolkien.
