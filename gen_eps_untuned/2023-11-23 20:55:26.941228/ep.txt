plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. The parents of Kyle disagree.
kyle: Kyle: "But you guys, we can't just stand by and let this happen! Those poor calves deserve a chance at life, not to end up as veal on someone's plate! We have to do something!"
stan: Stan: "I get it, dude. It's messed up. But my parents aren't gonna be cool with us bringing a bunch of calves home. They already freak out when I bring a stray cat around."
cartman: Eric: "Well, I can't believe we're even having this conversation. Who cares about some stupid calves? I'm more worried about getting some decent food around here. And if you think I'm letting a bunch of smelly animals come to my house, you're out of your mind, fatass!"
