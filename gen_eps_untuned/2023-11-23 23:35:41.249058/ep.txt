plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Cartman's house. Cartman disagrees and thinks they should be eaten.
kyle: KYLE: Cartman, how can you even suggest such a thing? These poor baby calves deserve a chance to live, not to be turned into veal! We must save them and find them a safe place to live, like your house!

CARTMAN: Are you freaking kidding me, Kyle? My house is not becoming a cow shelter! They belong in my belly, not in my backyard!

KYLE: It's not about what you want, Cartman! These animals have the right to live free from harm. We can't just let them be slaughtered for food. We have to do something!

CARTMAN: Screw your animal rights, Kyle! Veal is delicious, and I'm not giving up the chance to enjoy a good meal just because you suddenly grew a conscience!

KYLE: Well, maybe if you had a conscience, you'd understand that these calves deserve compassion, not to be treated as commodities. We can find a way to help them, but it won't involve eating them!

CARTMAN: Fine, Kyle! If you're so concerned about these damn calves, figure out a way to save them that doesn't involve my house or my dinner plans! But mark my words, one day you'll regret this decision!

KYLE: I won't regret doing what I believe is right, Cartman. And I'll find a way to save those calves, with or without your support. You just wait and see!
butters: BUTTERS: Gee whiz, fellas, I reckon we should try to find a solution that makes everyone happy. I mean, maybe there's a place where the calves can live safely, and we can still have a yummy dinner without hurting them. Maybe we can talk to the farmer and see if he'd be open to a different arrangement. Let's try to find a win-win, guys!
stan: STAN: Yeah, Butters is right, guys. We should try to find a solution that doesn't involve anyone getting hurt. I mean, it's not fair to these calves to just be seen as a meal ticket. Maybe we can talk to the farmer and see if there's another way, like finding them a sanctuary. That way, they can live out their lives happily, and we can still enjoy a meal without feeling guilty. We just have to believe that there's a better way, even if it means taking a stand against what society tells us is normal.
kyle: KYLE: You guys are right. We need to find a way to save these calves and ensure their well-being, without compromising our values. Let's talk to the farmer and explain our concerns. Maybe he'll be willing to consider a different approach, like sending the calves to a sanctuary or finding them loving homes instead of turning them into veal. We have to believe that change is possible and fight for what we know is right.
cartman: CARTMAN: Oh, for the love of God, you guys are such bleeding-heart liberals! Fine, let's waste our time talking to the farmer and finding the calves a damn sanctuary. But just remember, when those calves grow up and start destroying everything, don't come crying to me for help. I told you this was a stupid idea from the start. But whatever, I guess saving a few baby cows is more important than enjoying a mouth-watering, succulent veal dinner.
butters: BUTTERS: Well, fellas, maybe we can find a compromise. We could still talk to the farmer about the sanctuary idea and see if there's a way to ensure the calves won't cause any trouble. And then maybe we can all try some delicious vegetarian options too! That way, we can save the calves and satisfy our taste buds without causing harm. It's all about finding a balance, right?
kyle: KYLE: Butters, that's actually a great idea. We can have a vegetarian meal as a way of showing our support for the calves and promoting compassion towards animals. It's a win-win situation where we can still enjoy a delicious meal while standing up for what we believe in. Let's talk to the farmer and explore these options, and together, we can make a difference.
cartman: CARTMAN: Ugh, vegetarian options? Are you seriously suggesting that I, Eric Cartman, should give up meat just for the sake of some stupid calves? No way, Kyle! I refuse to be a part of your hippie, animal-loving crap! If you want to eat grass and tofu, be my guest. But I'll be over here enjoying a juicy steak, thank you very much!
