plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. The parents of Kyle disagree.
kyle: Kyle: "We have to do something, guys! We can't just sit back and let those poor calves be turned into veal. It's not right!"
stan: Stan: "I get it, dude. It's totally messed up. Those poor little guys don't deserve that. But, I don't know if bringing them to my house is the best plan. My parents might freak out, and I don't want the calves to end up in even more trouble."
butters: Butters: "Gee guys, I sure do feel bad for those little calves. Maybe we could find them a nice farm or something, like Old McDonald's place. They could have a real good time there."
cartman: Eric: "Oh, come on, you guys! Just let the calves become veal. They're going to taste super delicious, and I'm not about to let some dumb baby cows ruin my dinner plans. Plus, I'm pretty sure bringing them to Stan's house would be a terrible idea, like, seriously, dude."
