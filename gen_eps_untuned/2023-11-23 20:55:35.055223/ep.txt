plot: The kids of South Park agree to ignore Cartman, leading him to think that he is dead.
cartman: Eric: What the hell is going on here? Why is everyone ignoring me? This is some kind of sick joke, isn't it? Well, it's not going to work! I'm not dead, you idiots! I'm standing right here, you morons!
stan: Stan: Dude, Cartman, we're not trying to make you feel like you're dead. We're just tired of your crap and we don't want to deal with it anymore.
kyle: Kyle: Yeah, Cartman, you've been a total jerk, and we're just sick of it. You need to learn to treat people with respect if you want us to pay attention to you again.
