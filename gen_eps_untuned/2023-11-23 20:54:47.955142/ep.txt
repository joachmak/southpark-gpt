plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Butters is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Cartman's house. Cartman disagrees and thinks they should be eaten.
butters: Cartman, I just can't stand the thought of these poor little calves being turned into veal. They're just innocent little guys, and they deserve a chance at life, don't you think?
cartman: Cartman: Oh, come on Butters, don't be such a bleeding heart. Those calves are just gonna end up as a delicious, succulent meal. Besides, I have plans for a veal parmesan dinner party tomorrow and I'm not changing it for anyone.
stan: Stan: Butters, I think you're right. Those calves deserve a chance to live. Cartman, how can you be so heartless? They're just innocent animals, not food for your dinner party.
kyle: Kyle: Yeah, Cartman! How can you be so insensitive? Those calves deserve compassion and a chance at life, not to be treated as a meal for your dinner party! This is just wrong!
