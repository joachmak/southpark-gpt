plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Butters is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
butters: Butters: "Gee whiz, fellas, we just can't let those baby calves become veal. They're innocent little critters who deserve a chance at life. Let's bring 'em to Stan's house where they'll be safe and sound."
kyle: Kyle: "Butters, I get it, but we can't just bring a bunch of calves to Stan's house! What are we gonna do with them when they grow up? We need to come up with a better plan to help these calves, not just take them to our friend's house."
stan: Stan: "Yeah, Kyle's right, Butters. Bringing them to my house might not be the best idea. We need to figure out a plan that'll truly keep them safe and give them a chance at a full life. We can't just stick them in my backyard and hope for the best."
