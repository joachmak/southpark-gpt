plot: the boys go to the cinema to watch the new hunger games movie
kyle: Cartman: Can you believe they made another Hunger Games movie? It's just a cash grab at this point.
Kyle: Yeah, but I still want to see it. I think the message behind the story is important, despite the commercialization.
butters: Butters: Golly gee, I think the message of standing up for what's right is real important too! Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd sure like to join in and watch it with ya.
cartman: Eric Cartman: Ugh, standing up for what's right? Spare me the hippie nonsense, Butters. I'm just here for the popcorn and to see some teenagers fight to the death.
