plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. The boys are horrified (except Cartman, who joyously claims that they look so tender and scrumptious) and decide to save the calves from becoming veal. Stan, Kyle, and Butters persuade Cartman to help them rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
kyle: Cartman, you can't just ignore the suffering of these innocent animals! We have to do something to save them!
stan: Stan: Kyle's right, Cartman. These calves deserve better than being turned into veal. We have to find a way to help them and make sure they're safe.
butters: Butters: Golly, fellas, I sure do feel awful for these little guys. They're just so innocent and sweet, we gotta make sure they're okay. Maybe we can find them a nice place to stay and play, just like a big ol' puppy park!
