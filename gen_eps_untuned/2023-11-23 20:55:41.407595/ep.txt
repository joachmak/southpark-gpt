plot: Butters, Kyle, Stan and Cartman are solving the mystery of who stole the last chicken nugget. It must be one of the boys.
cartman: Eric Cartman: Yeah, it's obvious that the culprit is one of you guys. And I'm gonna find out who it is, because no one steals my chicken nuggets and gets away with it.
butters: Butters: Gosh, fellas, I wouldn't ever wanna steal a chicken nugget. I swear, I'd be too scared of getting grounded by my folks.
kyle: Kyle: That's right, Butters. We all know it wasn't you. We need to think about who could have done this and find the truth.
