plot: The kids of South Park agree to ignore Cartman, leading him to think that he is dead.
butters: Butters: Oh geez, guys, I don't know if ignoring Cartman is such a good idea. What if he gets really sad and feels all alone? Maybe we could try talking to him instead and help him understand why we're upset with him.
stan: Stan: Yeah, Butters, I get where you're coming from, but we've tried talking to Cartman before. He just doesn't listen or care about anyone else's feelings. Ignoring him might actually make him realize the consequences of his actions. Plus, it's important to stand up for ourselves and not let him walk all over us anymore. We have to show him that his behavior is unacceptable.
cartman: Cartman: Oh, cry me a river, you bunch of crybaby pansies! Ignoring me is the best thing you dummies could do. Maybe if you actually grow a pair and stand up to me, I'll finally learn that I can't always get my way. But knowing you losers, you'll cave in like always and come crawling back to me. Just watch, I'll make you beg for my attention!
kyle: Kyle: Cartman, you really have no idea how much of a jerk you are, do you? Ignoring you isn't some cruel punishment, it's a way for us to protect ourselves from your constant manipulation and hurtful behavior. We're not trying to make you feel sad or alone, we just want some peace and respect. Maybe if you took a moment to reflect on your actions and how they affect people, you'd actually start to grow as a person. But I won't hold my breath, because deep down, I know you'll always be the same selfish, arrogant Cartman.
