plot: the boys are trying to find out who ate the last kfc chicken nugget. Cartman blames butters, but butters is innocent and cute. Kyle is jewish so he cannot eat chicken?
cartman: Butters, you little weasel, I know it was you! You're always sneaking around, trying to steal food! Admit it, you ate the last KFC chicken nugget! And don't give me those innocent puppy dog eyes, I'm onto you!
butters: Butters: Oh gosh, no, fellers, it wasn't me, honest! I would never do something like that. I mean, I do love me some fried chicken, but I pinky promise it wasn't me. Maybe a squirrel got in the house and ate it, huh?
stan: Stan: Guys, calm down. Butters wouldn't do something like that. We need to figure this out without pointing fingers and making accusations. Maybe we should check if anyone else had access to the chicken nuggets. And Cartman, don't be so quick to blame Butters just because he's an easy target.
kyle: Kyle: Yeah, Cartman, lay off of Butters. And for the record, I wouldn't and couldn't eat the chicken nugget, being Jewish and all. Let's just figure out what really happened and not jump to conclusions.
