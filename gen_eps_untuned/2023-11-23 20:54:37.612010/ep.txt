plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. The boys are horrified (except Cartman, who joyously claims that they look so tender and scrumptious) and decide to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters and Kyle persuade Cartman to help them rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
butters: Butters: "Gee whiz, fellas, I sure hope we did the right thing. I mean, those little calves are just so darn cute, and I don't think they'd like to be turned into veal, you know?"
stan: Stan: "Yeah, Butters, I know what you mean. I can't believe they were going to do that to those innocent little calves. We had to do something. They deserve a chance at a better life, not to end up on someone's dinner plate."
cartman: Eric: "You guys are such bleeding hearts. Those calves were just going to end up being veal, but now they'll probably just end up as someone's pets, or worse, hipster food. Ugh, the things I do for you guys."
kyle: Kyle: "We did the right thing, Butters. Those calves deserve a chance to live without being exploited for food. It's just not fair to them."
