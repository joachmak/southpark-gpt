plot: The kids of South Park agree to ignore Cartman, leading him to think that he is dead.
<scene>: stan`s house, night. the boys are in the kitchen sitting at the breakfast table anticipating something. next to kenny is a stack of plates
cartman: Mm, okay, so it looks like we're expecting, what, maybe five people for breakfast?
stan: Yeah, something like that.
cartman: [checks the plates] And the next one goes there. And... next one goes right there. [places a plate next to kenny] Great. Good. All right, fellas, let's move on to syrup now.
kyle: since cartman is so retarded i don't understand why we're waiting for him to see if he died.
stan: we're not waiting for cartman to see if he's dead, we're waiting for the right time to tell him he's not dead! so we can rip on him!
cartman: yes, but it still seems retarded!
stan: here he comes.
cartman: hey guys. what's goin' on in here?
stan: nothing.
cartman: oh, kyle. nachos. [stands, goes to the stove, gets a pot of soup, and sets it next to kenny. he goes back to the stove for a pot of stew, places that next to kenny, and goes back for a pot of chili. he sets that next to kenny, then goes back for a pot of soup. he places that next to kenny, and goes back for a]opsyched!
stan: dude, sit down!
cartman: you guys, something really interesting just happened, you guys
stan: dude, shut up. sit down and eat your breakfast.
cartman: totally anti-tacobellatis plate all ready for syrup.
stan: dude, drop it, okay? just sit down. [the kids resume eating their breakfast]
cartman: how do you guys feel if, say, instead of kenny right here, we put... [places a plate next to... stand this time. and instead of bacon, we went with, uh... say... cube steak. then right here next to... jimmy... we went with... sausage? and then next... to kyle, we went with ham. and as eggs, next to stan, we went with fish sticks. and finally, instead of... kenny... let's go with, let's say... fried perch. how would that be?
stan: aw dude! you made kenny's mom make you breakfast just so you could give her your fish. that's not cool!
cartman: no, stan, that's a breakfast mix-up. now, what if instead of mine and jimmy's mom's lunches, we put them in speeches. and then, for beverages, instead of coffee, we substitute cartoons. for hash browns, instead of... tortillas... say... um... videos of plane crashes. for butter, instead of butter, you go with. comedy central presents. and then concentrated orange juice, you change to... safari animals at their most violent. [picks up his fork and murmurs] oh-so-cool. [picks up his knife and murmurs] interested. and we're talking breakfast mix-up here. what're the. consequences?execution, mr. twiks. what're the. consequences? [goes to the stove, joins chef. the kids gather round in a line. worden and vice principal woman watch on. eric... and the other kids sing the school flatulation song]
stan: [deadpanning to the camera] school flatulation day.
cartman: children passing gas in the halls.
stan: hello, adults. it's me, the chef. now, we've all been called together because there seems to be a little confusion about the word... "fart."
cartman: fart. the word fart is defined as a french word meaning "to blow." or "poot. "
stan: [uneasy] ...poot.
cartman: what we find strange is that the word... "fart" is used... in. public. and popular television, but we can't use it in chester's speech?
stan: that's correct.
cartman: okay everyone...
stan: welcome, everyone, to the silent protest.
cartman: please remove your hats if you have them on, and observe a moment of silence for the people who aren't here to protest.
stan: ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, i stand before you today as an american... and a son of a father. we are all here today... to honor... [a long silence] those who aren't here to join us in honor. because they can't protest! we need to ask ourselves... isn't it time... for not silence? [silence]

[fewer and fewer people clap]
cartman: ...but. the voiceless. need. a. voice. [silence. silence. then a few people clap again] it's [cartman pulls out a cue card ] time. for. us. to. say. "no." [clap...] to. silence!
stan: thank you, mr. twiks. i think you made the most compelling argument. the school administration will now reconsider our decision.
cartman: hella turbulent times in this country. seems like since the year 2000 more and more people are caught in the crossfire of being pro-"fart" or anti-"fart". but should it really be the people who are divided... or the words they use?
stan: well said, eric.
cartman: gentlemen, i believe i have everyone's attention. i propose that we, the body of [mfm] young evangelists [mfm] go forth and reclaim [mfm] good taste, laughter and evilness [mfm] for ourselves. freshmen, kyle and stan, will have jobs as followers, who will grow a goatee and make their voices raspy. now, we need to identify our enemies, those believers who are spreading gooey, disgusting ideas [mfm] so that we, yes   you   can rip them apart [mfm] the arnnolt twins announced plans to go to terrance and phillip 'that's left the backstabber kenny, and the girl living in a fantasy world, butters. we're not forgetting about you jimmy, we just don't know who you are. that leaves the traitor, kyle, jimmy, butters,   this taunting   ain't cool   kenny...   and his    gay [mfm] hobbit. [mfm] all right, then, i believe... we understand [mfm] our first target, the school useless

[when the bus arrives at the school: long minutes of silence]
cartman: ...this will also be known as "music lesson one."
stan: dude, i don't know how to play the flute.
cartman: that `s okay, kyle. neither does any soldier in a flutist regiment. what we need is just enough knowledge to be able to make [mfm] fun of it... [mfm]
stan: [goes] to our next lesson: [mfm] understanding the importance of a [mfm] great... saxophone [mfm] solo. and on saturday. we 're going to hit him. with "show choir"? no. piano recital. if we hit him with "show choir" we still won't be considered as being very "evil."
cartman: no, that's a way of making a point. if we hit him with "saxophone solo" though... we'll be telling them, "watch out, world! these guys mean business!"
stan: oh, sweet, this is the rest of the week. [the class bell rings] kenny go ahead and give us a second.
cartman: the... deep inside (deeper!) im the savage beast (ooh yeah!) i'm... the dirt of sweating sex. i never brush my teeth. i tell my mom to shut up and my dad has a very hairy covenant. [outside, to the other students] you guys make me sick!
stan: [comes out of the school with] cool, so, saturday. we break into the one place where they won't be on guard.
cartman: the comedy club.
stan: that's right. if there's one thing that all great holy wars... and world wars have taught us, is that there is one place where they are safe, everytime. if we strike them there, we will throw this entire school into madness! [raises his fist] evil is on the rise!
cartman: your face puts my ass to sleep.
stan: oh really? your ass sleeps?
cartman: yeah, i learned how to make it do that last night. [the other kids], i'll teach you how, stan. [the girls, uh hunh] i promise you.
stan: uh, dude? we need to go right now.
cartman: hoh, no. just what this school needs. [several flakes drop from the sky]
stan: [repeatedly looking up] dude, i-i think it's snowing outside.
cartman: whoa! [all [south park students] fly through the top of the bus and through the windows. the bus slides on, now empty, and crashes through the bus depot wall at the other end. the students themselves fly toward the heavens
cartman: we were cloudmodal choirs. led to victory by our trumpet player, who performed the most amazing trombone solo anyone has ever heard. and then, we just died. we didn't even make the health most considerate.
stan: dude, do you realize you did it again?
cartman: oh. [opens up a cue card] no, i...went too far. [puts the cue card away] i love kenny... with all of my heart. [goes back to his seat] i swear to god.
stan: well dude, i can't believe it, but it looks like we literally did it.
cartman: but... what are we gonna do if he's not dead?
statoner bush-petes, we gotta... just handle it! [hangs his head] oh... man.
stan: oh, man.
cartman: here he comes.
stan: hey, guys! [the others except for kyle glare at cartman, but otherwise ignore him] so, uh, guys, that's weird. but. it says on the bus memorandum that i died. so... i guess this is it. you know. careful what you... [a short pause] wish for.

[the others except for kyle glare at cartman, but otherwise ignore him] pathMatchose... does. anyone remember. what. we were all doing... before i died?
cartman: i don't know. what were WE all doing before you died?
stan: oh, nothing. just doing.... OUR thing. and life. [the others lower their heads]
cartman: good one. [they all laugh a little, and stan looks over to kyle. kyle looks straight out at the bus. kenny is dead and flies through the window in the corner]
cartman: [smacks his face] aw. god, damnit!
stan: ...[points to cartman] hoho, so you DO touch the sky, do you? [the kids begin to laugh. cartman begins to tear up, but then... the corner] who is it? [kyle turns to] that isn't possible! how can he be [the kids return to their seats, and pretend to bend over dead. cartman runs over to kenny] guys! this isn't funny! kenny is really dead be-[kenny and the other students] ...he... guys? [...are carried by the... bus... again?] he-hey! h-h-he's lined up next to everybody, he... he... [the clouds part, giving cartman a clear view of the sky] ...guys? [the sky is filled with clouds except for one circle around the sun] ...where did he go? [the others all... eye cartman] ...guys?
cartman: ha ha!
stan: [the bus stops. the kids eye each other, then, all back out of the bus and run] behind that fence! [they turn a corner and run north] keep running! [they pass a stop sign and run down a sidewalk. three kids are walking a red toy car up ahead. ]y-yeah! they're away from us now! [they run inside a building, and the other kids continue walking] go! go! [stops] oh, crap. [the south park kids continue running all the way to cartman`s neighborhood. Ein FEMOh. [runs inside his home] m-mom! mom, wake up! wake up, mom! mom! my friends are dead! my friends are dead! [lacks of air] their- their dead! the- they- [his mom,,, groans, then sits up. littlery... what isn't she... sl ? what isn't... ? [she sits up, looking groggy. his face is streaked with tears] how did this- how did it happen? [the other boys run up to the front door] how the FUCK did this happen?!
cartman: aw, goddamit!
stan: [runs up] cartman, we found another way to bring kenny back to life! we have to get to the hospital before it's too late!
cartman: [runs back outside] aw, god, damnit!
stan: mom, i need your car! [his mom tosses him the car keys, he catches them. kyle and stan run around to the passenger side of the car] i need your car! [they get in, and cartman starts it up. he pauses to look left before pulling out to the right] this is my mom's shitty car. we're gonna have to take it really slow and careful. [they start to drive]
cartman: my god, this is desperate. stan, listen very carefully. on the count of three, slam your hands against the horn. two and three. [stan opens his hands and slams them against the innëu-aaaah! [hits the curb] shit-balls! [loops their hand back through the wheel and resumes driving] so [heh] we do have certain faith in kenny...'s necrophilic skills with little will.
stan: girl down the corner, stan. [both turn their heads as the pass by.] [does a double take] [stops] guys? [both look back.] you guys, 30 seconds ago, i saw that same old lady on this corner! [gathers the bboys] ...stan, dude, i saw her, too! i s-saw her, too! do you think kenny was the first victim of something? what-if some deranged psycho is going around killing off all old-people-faith-hoarders? but, but [the.qq. [they turn around in time to see a van at the end of the stret pull off and turn the corner.] guys, do you realize what? we're on the corner of third and löppü. [the car backs up, then charges at the gang, honking. they dive out of the way, except for cartman.] ...piggly wiggly's with clothes! [the van charges cartman and nothie to repeatedly. stan hides his face.] o gods, i, [the blonde man finds his face on a mug laden lae...t] g-guys. kenny could be alive, but we're not really-alive. we're just equally fucked.
cartman: that thing chasing him. was that kenny`vangst isOpen the front door!
stan: --can you help me.

cartman: yip.
stan: [drops thise glasses] god dammit, this better be important! [the door opens. kenny`s dad is behind it, still in his underthings, holding the paper.] mork.
