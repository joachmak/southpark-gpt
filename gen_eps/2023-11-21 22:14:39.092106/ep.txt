plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. The parents of Kyle disagree.
kyle: I don't care what my parents say! I'm not going to let those defenseless calves be turned into veal!
stan: Dude, I get it. We have to save them.
kyle: Yeah, we have to do something. They can't just kill those poor animals.
stan: Yeah, it's not right. Those calves didn't do anything to deserve this.
kyle: I know! Let's all pitch in and buy the calves from the farmer!
stan: But how are we gonna take care of them, dude?
