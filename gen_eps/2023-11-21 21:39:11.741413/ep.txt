plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. The boys are horrified (except Cartman, who joyously claims that they look so tender and scrumptious) and decide to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters and Kyle persuade Cartman to help them rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
cartman: Hey, that is so tender and scrumptious!
kyle: Are you kidding me, Cartman? They're just babies!
cartman: Oh, grow up, Kyle! They look so tender and scrumptious!
kyle: We need to save them, Cartman!
cartman: Save them? From what? I just said how tender and scrumptious they look!
kyle: We need to save them from becoming veal, you heartless asshole!
cartman: Hey, just because I appreciate the sight of a delicious baby doesn't mean I want to see it get slaughtered!
kyle: Oh, so now you care about their well-being?
cartman: No, I care about my well-being! I care about having plenty of veal to eat! That's what I care about!
kyle: You can go to hell, Cartman!
cartman: (dramatically) Oh, I'm already going to hell, Kyle. I'm already going to hell.
stan: You guys, we can't let these calves become veal! They're just babies!
cartman: Could I get a side of mashed potatoes, please?
stan: Dude, this is serious! Calves shouldn't be treated like this!
cartman: Oh, so now we're worried about how calves feel? Who's this "we" stuff?
kyle: Yeah, Cartman, who's this "we" stuff?
cartman: Yeah, who's this "we" stuff, Kyle?
kyle: We!
cartman: Alright, fine. But don't come crying to me if everybody thinks you're a little faggot who can't stand up for himself.
kyle: Well, I'm not gonna just let these calves be treated like this!
cartman: Oh, like you really care about the calves, Kyle! You just want to impress your girlfriend, Jessica!
kyle: No, I don't!
cartman: Somebody likes Jessica.
kyle: Fine, dude! We don't give a crap about Jessica! We just care about saving these calves!
cartman: Yeah! We want to save the cows! We're going to take them to your house, Stan.
stan: My house? What for?
cartman: Because you've got the biggest bedroom! And you can feed them with your mom's boobs, Stan!
stan: ...What?
cartman: Yeah, they can just suck away. I don't find that weird at all.
stan: This isn't about my house or Jessica, you guys. This is about doing what's right!
cartman: Yeah, doing what's right will end up getting you laid, Stanley.
stan: Dude, I don't care about getting laid!
cartman: Sure, and I don't care about living. But we each have our own crosses to bear.
stan: Alright, let's go save those calves!
cartman: Oh, goody! It's calf-savey time!
stan: We have to hurry! This could be our only chance to save them!
cartman: Yeah, we've got to hurry so we can save those cute, tender little creatures.
stan: Dude, you're not helping!
cartman: What?! What?! I'm totally committed to the cause here!
stan: Could you at least pretend to care about these animals?
cartman: Fine! [breaks into tears] I'm sorry, little cows, for appreciating just how delicious you are. [sobs]
stan: [joins in] Oh, it's just so sad! [sobs]
cartman: [sobs] Look, look how tender and scrumptious little baby cow meat is! [sobs]
stan: you guys, this is serious. calves shouldn't be treated like this.
cartman: Oh boo-hoo! Who's this "we" you're talking about?
stan: ...yeah, who's this "we" stuff, Kyle? [breaks into tears] [sobs] look, look how tender and scrumptious little baby cow meat is...
cartman: [sobs] and we're just letting it be slaughtered! [sobs] [sobs]
stan: all right, enough!
cartman: [sniffs] stop getting involved with animal rights groups, you guys. [sobs] they never pay off. 
stan: fine. (the boys climb through the window)
cartman: let's go get those calves! [breaks down sobbing again] [sobs] they're so tender and delicious! [sobs]
stan: [annoyed] will you stop it, cartman?! [somberly] we have to save these calves before it's too late.
cartman: together, you guys, before it's too late! [sobs]
stan: okay, okay, just stop it, cartman.
cartman: [stops crying] okay
stan: (apologetically) i'm sorry. i'm just trying to be supportive of you, even though i don't really give a crap about what we're doing.
cartman: no, it's okay, stan. i understand.
stan: [glares at cartman] let's just go save those calves.
cartman: i'm all in with you, stan, to save the cows! as long as the calves continue to be adorable and scrumptious. [sniffles] [choking up] [sobs]
stan: (frustrated) you said you were done crying!
cartman: i'm sorry. [sobs] [sobs] i don't want to. [sobs] [sobs] i just can't help it.
stan: [annoyed] just hurry up and get in!
cartman: okay, i'm coming. [sobs] [sucks snot back into his nose] [hurries into stan's bedroom]
stan: [follows suit] [sucks snot back into his nose] [hurries into stan's bedroom]
cartman: wouldn't it be nice if cows reproduced in the human manner?
stan: ugh!
cartman: i wouldn't be the first in line to suck a cow's baby calves.
stan: ugh!
cartman: you never know. i mean, it's worth a shot.
stan: cartman, jesus!
cartman: huh? what?
stan: nothing.
cartman: let's just hurry up and get there so we can save the cows.
stan: (going out on a limb) but... we're not saving the cows. we're saving the calves.
cartman: i know, i was just saying so that everybody understood.
stan: all right. [they climb out the window, and we follow them as they make their way to the farm]
cartman: [to himself] you know, as soon as we get back, i'm gonna have some veal and waffles. [follows stan]
stan: (annoyed) goddamnit, cartman!
cartman: what? what?! what did i do? [follows stan]
stan: just stop talking about eating veal, okay? [they find themselves in front of the entrance to the farm, guarded by cobra security]
cartman: [rushing to catch up to stan] okay, fine! [pauses] when we get back, i'm gonna have some veal nuggets and a veal smoothie. [follows stan into the farm]
stan: [dismayed] why do i even try with you?! [follows stan into the farm]
cartman: i am rich, butters, thanks for noticing. let's hit it, guys. [the boys enter a roomkhaki... hold this.
stan: okay, guys. this is it. we have one shot to save these calves.
cartman: i know, butters. i always know.
butters: uh, you guys, is somebody gonna tell butters he's not in this episode?
cartman: you think people are watching another cartoon about cows, butters?
stan: jesus, you don't get it, do you?
cartman: [long] no, we don't get it. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. [clears his throat, then takes a deep breath] [sings] [singing] on this special day when our savior was born [singing] it's tradition, for people to go out [singing] and buy... the newest stuff [singing] but to do [singing] so they have to get in line.
stan: and in order to get in line, buddha, you need money. and in order to get money, hands have to shovel dog doo all day long. it's-it's-it's *natural*!
cartman: what the hell does that have to do with anything?
stan: yep, you don't get it, do you?
cartman: not gonna happen.
stan: what do you mean?
cartman: hasn't hehve told you?
stan: told us what?
