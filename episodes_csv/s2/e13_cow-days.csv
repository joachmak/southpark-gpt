2;13;;A game show. The audience is applauding a couple onstage. The host and his assistant stand near the contestants.
2;13;Host;Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?
2;13;Tom and Mary;We're ready, Bob!
2;13;Bob;Any particular prize you're hoping for?
2;13;Mary;Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!
2;13;Tom;Oh, anywhere'd be great!
2;13;Bob;Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
2;13;;A 9 second count-down begins.
2;13;Tom;Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this.
2;13;;Tom grips his head with both hands as time runs out.
2;13;Mary;The upper vascular hood.
2;13;Bob;I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
2;13;;Tom and Mary are overjoyed.
2;13;Bob;Fred tell 'em what they've won.
2;13;Fred the Announcer;Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!
2;13;;A woman dressed as a cowgirl shows off a picture of the town. The audience oohs and aahs.
2;13;Mary;Where?
2;13;Fred the Announcer;That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.
2;13;;A poster of Cow Days appears, then rotates to one of South Park. Scenes of the announcer's descriptions appear.
2;13;Fred the Announcer;Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!
2;13;;The audience Awww's as a group of cows is shown.
2;13;Fred the Announcer;Congratulations, Tom and Mary.
2;13;Bob;Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
2;13;Tom;What was second prize again?
2;13;Bob;That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
2;13;;The audience joins him in saying.
2;13;Bob and Audience;Ooo, What The Hell Is That!
2;13;;The theme music plays before they cut to commercial.
2;13;Mary;Ah shit!
2;13;;South Park rodeo. A rider falls from his horse as it jumps some barrels, nearby on the carnival stage,  Mayor McDaniels and her aides are standing.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!
2;13;;Cheers go up. Mayor McDaniels and her aides wear Cow Days buttons. Others wear Cow Days shirts and wave little flags with cow designs on them.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow.
2;13;;The crowd cheers wildly.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
2;13;;Jimbo walks up to the mic.
2;13;Jimbo;This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
2;13;;A giant curtain covers a large object.
2;13;Jimbo;Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
2;13;;The curtain comes down and a large statue of a cow is revealed. It's wooden, buddhaesque, in appearance, a dark gold color, with a large clock encased in its belly. The clock shows 1 p.m. The statue moos and the crowd cheers. Ned is at the front of the crowd, as are Tom and Mary.
2;13;Mary;This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
2;13;Tom;Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.
2;13;Mary;Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
2;13;;"The carnival gets underway. People mill around, the boys approach a booth that says ""3 for $5""."
2;13;Toss-a-Ball operator;Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes.
2;13;Kyle;Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;;A fanfare plays as a close-up of the dolls are shown.
2;13;Stan;Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
2;13;Kyle;Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
2;13;Operator;Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
2;13;Stan;Really?
2;13;Operator;Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves.
2;13;;"The operator shows the boys the tag, which reads

""TEÐ¯ENSE AND PHILLUP"""
2;13;Cartman;Wwow!
2;13;Kyle;Dude, that kicks ass!
2;13;Cartman;[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
2;13;Operator;Five dollars for three balls.
2;13;Cartman;Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
2;13;Operator;Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth.
2;13;;A wooden board featuring a photo of Jennifer Love Hewitt's face is shown, a gaping hole where her mouth should be.
2;13;Cartman;That's easy!
2;13;Operator;Okay, we've got a player!
2;13;Cartman;Ay! Check it out!
2;13;;He tosses a ball and misses, just to the right of the mouth.
2;13;Cartman;Damn it!
2;13;Operator;It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
2;13;Cartman;Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
2;13;;He chucks another ball at her, and misses.
2;13;Kyle;You suck, Cartman!
2;13;Cartman;I'd like to see you do better!
2;13;Kyle;Give me that!
2;13;;Kyle takes the final ball from Cartman, and throws it. Direct hit, it goes into the mouth, but falls out and away.
2;13;Kyle;Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
2;13;Operator;It's gotta go through her mouth.
2;13;Kyle;But ih-
2;13;Operator;Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
2;13;Kyle;Here, give me some money, Cartman!
2;13;;Cartman looks at him and starts laughing.
2;13;Kyle;Lend me money, fat boy!
2;13;Cartman;I only have three dollars left, asshole!
2;13;Kyle;Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
2;13;;The boys walk off.
2;13;Jimbo;[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!
2;13;;The crowd cheers. Kyle has found his parents.
2;13;Kyle;Mom, give me some money!
2;13;Sheila;Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
2;13;Kyle;I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Sheila;Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!
2;13;Kyle;I will if you give me money!
2;13;Sheila;Okay, here!
2;13;;She hands him some bills, and he walks off.
2;13;Cartman;Sweet.
2;13;;Back on stage, Jimbo gives more instructions to the crowd, which is still cheering.
2;13;Jimbo;Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.
2;13;;The crowd pays no heed and keeps cheering.
2;13;Jimbo;With that said, let's rock and roll!
2;13;;The crowd strains at the starting line. Halfy is there, too.
2;13;Jimbo;Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
2;13;;The corral  doors open, but not a cow moves. The crowd rushes forth.
2;13;Jimbo;They're loose!
2;13;;Jimbo leaves the stage, the cows look bewildered at the townsfolk.
2;13;Cows;Mooooo?!
2;13;;The townsfolk scream wildly, while the cows remain in the corral and moo some more. Ned runs directly into a telephone pole and falls.
2;13;Ned;Ow.
2;13;;One cow timidly leaves the corral. A townsman looks back as he runs, and finds himself impaled on the lower half of a shattered phone pole.
2;13;Jimbo;[Running by.] Yeehaw!
2;13;;A red heifer chews on some grass just outside the corral. A man comes and tries to provoke a grazing cow, but the cow ignores him. The man shakes his ass at the cow, then runs away screaming.
2;13;;"Back at the carnival, a ride named ""Chamber of Farts"" stands near a Ferris wheel. Its entrance consists of a huge lavender ass with doors through which the cars enter."
2;13;Kyle;Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
2;13;Cartman;I only need one, dude. I only need one.
2;13;Operator;Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
2;13;Stan;What's that?
2;13;Operator;Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
2;13;Cartman;How much is it?
2;13;Operator;Just three tickets, boys.
2;13;Chamber of Farts Ride;Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
2;13;Kyle;Is it like a- haunted house or something?
2;13;Operator;Sure. It's veery scary.
2;13;Cartman;Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
2;13;Kyle;No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Cartman;Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
2;13;Kyle;You'd better be right, dude.
2;13;Cartman;I'm right!
2;13;;The boys step up to the ride and car 15 comes to them. They get in.
2;13;Operator;Keep your hands inside at all times.
2;13;Kyle;Okay.
2;13;;They go in. They pass through a cemetery with asses everywhere. A man has his pants down just enough for his ass to poke through, a dog next to him has its tail up, there are flying asses about, and some volcanoes poke through the ground. All are farting. The car stops.
2;13;Chamber of Farts ride;So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!
2;13;;The car starts up again, and Cartman gets a dose of farts from an ass jet.
2;13;Cartman;Eh! God-damnit!
2;13;;As they enter the Hall of Farts, a wailing fart is heard from two figures hanging from spider webs.
2;13;Stan;What the hell was that?
2;13;Chamber of Farts ride;Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
2;13;;The car heads for a woman stretched out in torture. A weak fart escapes from her. The car leaves the Gas Caverns.
2;13;Operator;All right, boys. Ride's over.
2;13;Kyle;That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
2;13;Stan;Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
2;13;Cartman;[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
2;13;Kyle;That was a waste of money, Cartman!
2;13;Operator;Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
2;13;Kyle;We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
2;13;Cartman;Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
2;13;;Cartman is down to $11.00, as he goes to get in line for the ride.
2;13;Cartman;Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
2;13;;The Cow Memorial, 12:59 p.m. A cow comes to look at the statue, and the clock strikes 1 p.m. The statue moos. The cow looks around, then moos. Two more cows arrive. In the other area of the carnival, the boys are nearing the end of the line for the ride.
2;13;Kyle;This ride better be good!
2;13;Stan;Yeah, this line is way too long!
2;13;Cartman;I think we're almost to the end.
2;13;Kyle;We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
2;13;Stan;Here we go.
2;13;;"The boys pass under a banner that reads

""LINE RIDE"""
2;13;Kyle;Finally!
2;13;Line ride operator;Did ya enjoy the ride?
2;13;Stan;What ride?
2;13;Kyle;Yeah.
2;13;Line ride operator;This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
2;13;Kyle;Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
2;13;Line ride operator;That's five tickets, thank you very much.
2;13;;The boys leave with $6.00 remaining.
2;13;Line ride operator;Come see us again soon.
2;13;Stan;My ass we will!
2;13;Kyle;Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
2;13;Stan;Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
2;13;Photo seller;Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
2;13;;They are shown the picture.
2;13;Cartman;How much?
2;13;Photo seller;Just three dollars.
2;13;Cartman;Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
2;13;;They are now left with $3.00.
2;13;Kyle;You dumbass, Cartman!
2;13;Cartman;What? This is cool.
2;13;Kyle;No, it's not cool!
2;13;Cartman;It is, too!
2;13;;They head back over to the Toss-A-Ball.
2;13;Operator;Can I help you boys.
2;13;Stan;We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
2;13;Operator;O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
2;13;Kyle;How much do we have left, Cartman?
2;13;;Cartman leafs through the bills, but doesn't answer.
2;13;Kyle;How much do we have left, Cartman?!
2;13;Cartman;Aah, three dollars.
2;13;Kyle;What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
2;13;Cartman;Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
2;13;Kyle;You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
2;13;;Kyle lunges at Cartman, and they fall to the ground, wrestling.
2;13;Cartman;Ey! Seriously!
2;13;;A view of the carnival. After a while the boys calm down and stand up again.
2;13;Kyle;Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
2;13;Cartman;Well, I'm sorry!
2;13;Kyle;Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
2;13;Cartman;[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
2;13;Kenny;[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)
2;13;Stan;Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
2;13;Operator;Sure, as long as they're good.
2;13;Kyle;Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
2;13;Kenny;(Nuh uh.)
2;13;Kyle;Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
2;13;Kenny;(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
2;13;Cartman;Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
2;13;;Kenny hands them to the operator, and Kyle receives the balls.
2;13;Kyle;Okay. Here we go.
2;13;;Kyle chucks the first ball directly into Jennifer's mouth, but it bounces away.
2;13;Kyle;Hey! That was right on target.
2;13;Operator;Sorry, kid. Try again.
2;13;;Kyle throws the next ball in, again directly on target, but it too bounces away.
2;13;Kyle;That does it! Shenanigans!
2;13;;He points an accusing finger at the operator, then turns around.
2;13;Kyle;SHENANIGANS!
2;13;Operator;Uhwhat are you doing?
2;13;Kyle;I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
2;13;Operator;Shenanigans?
2;13;Officer Barbrady;What's all the hoo-ha?
2;13;Kyle;Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Why?
2;13;Kyle;This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
2;13;Officer Barbrady;If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.
2;13;;Barbrady raises his baton and points it at the operator.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;What do you have to say, carnival operator?
2;13;Operator;Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.
2;13;;The operator reaches inside the counter and switches balls to give Kyle a smaller one.
2;13;Operator;Here you go.
2;13;;Kyle tosses it, and it soars through the mouth.
2;13;Operator;There, you see? We have a winner!
2;13;Kyle;It worked!
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
2;13;Stan;Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Barbrady!
2;13;Stan;Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
2;13;Officer Barbrady;You said Buttbaby.
2;13;;The boys start laughing after a few seconds.
2;13;Cartman;Sweet.
2;13;Operator;Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
2;13;Kyle;No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
2;13;Operator;Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
2;13;Kyle;What?!
2;13;Operator;You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Kyle;You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
2;13;Operator;[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!
2;13;Kyle;Damnit, I have to have those dolls!
2;13;;He walks off pissed. The others follow.
2;13;Stan;This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
2;13;Kyle;[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000.
2;13;;The boys look at him.
2;13;Kyle;Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
2;13;Cartman;What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
2;13;Kyle;[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
2;13;Cartman;O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
2;13;Kyle;All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!
2;13;;Kyle walks away. The others watch him.
2;13;Stan;[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
2;13;Cartman;I guess, damn!
2;13;;Tom and Mary have just exited the Chamber of Farts on car 11.
2;13;Mary;That ride wasn't very good.
2;13;Tom;Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time.
2;13;Mary;You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time.
2;13;;The Cow Memorial. The clock now reads 1:59 p.m., and seven cows stand before the memorial. Two o'clock strikes, and the statue moos twice. The cows answer with two moos of their own. More cows arrive. Meanwhile, at a nearby bar.
2;13;Stan;Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
2;13;Cartman;Hey, this is sweet.
2;13;Kyle;You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
2;13;Cartman;I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
2;13;Stan;We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
2;13;;Kenny presses the switch, and the mechanical bull starts to move.
2;13;Cartman;Ye-gah!
2;13;;The bull throws him off, and he lands in a Zoomin' Pinball machine, face up.
2;13;Cartman;Ow!
2;13;;Cartman shattered the glass, which scatters all around.
2;13;Cartman;Son of a bitch!
2;13;Stan;How long was that?
2;13;Kyle;That wasn't quite ten seconds.
2;13;Stan;Damn it!
2;13;;They all walk over to Cartman.
2;13;Stan;That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
2;13;Cartman;[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!
2;13;Kyle;Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!
2;13;Cartman;[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
2;13;;None of the boys step forth to help him.
2;13;Cartman;Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
2;13;Kyle;What'd you say, Cartman??
2;13;Cartman;[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
2;13;Kyle;I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
2;13;Cartman;[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
2;13;;The cows are now pushing the memorial across open fields. It now reads 3 p.m.
2;13;;Elsewhere, the boys stand next to a rancher who has offered his bull for Cartman to practice on.
2;13;Rancher;Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
2;13;Kyle;Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
2;13;Rancher;Well, have fun, boys.
2;13;Kyle;Okay, Cartman. You ready?
2;13;Cartman;[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
2;13;Kyle;Open the gate!
2;13;;Kenny opens it. The bull stands there, then walks out slowly and turns left.
2;13;Cartman;All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
2;13;Kyle;[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
2;13;Cartman;Yeah, this is sweet!
2;13;Stan;What are you going to do?
2;13;Kyle;Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
2;13;Stan;Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
2;13;;Kyle chucks a snowball at the bull's testicles and gets a direct hit. The bull starts bucking, pissed off.
2;13;Cartman;Eeyy!
2;13;Kyle;That's better.
2;13;Stan;Hold on, Cartman!
2;13;Cartman;Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
2;13;;The bull throws him off.
2;13;Cartman;Mother f-
2;13;;Before he can finish, he is thrust into the snow in front of them.
2;13;Kyle;Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!
2;13;;No response.
2;13;Stan;Come on, Cartman.
2;13;;No response.
2;13;Kenny;(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
2;13;Kyle;No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!
2;13;;Kyle kicks Cartman.
2;13;Kyle;Get up!
2;13;;Kyle waits a moment, then kicks him again.
2;13;Kyle;Get UP!
2;13;;Cartman stirs, then stands up. He's pale.
2;13;Stan;You okay, dude?
2;13;;Cartman says nothing, he sees everything undulate and hears Stan's voice echo.
2;13;Stan;Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
2;13;Kyle;Dude, I think we broke him.
2;13;;Later, at Hell's Pass Hospital, in the waiting area.
2;13;Dr. Doctor;Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.
2;13;Stan;What's the matter with him.
2;13;Dr. Doctor;Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
2;13;Kyle;..Oh.
2;13;Stan;But can he still ride a bull?
2;13;Dr. Doctor;What?
2;13;Kyle;We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
2;13;Dr. Doctor;No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep.
2;13;;Dr. Doctor turns and walks away.
2;13;Kyle;Damn it!
2;13;;Now in Cartman's room.
2;13;Stan;Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
2;13;Cartman;"BÃ¢n xÆ°a, Lee bÃ¢n xÆ°a!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)"
2;13;Stan;What?!
2;13;Cartman;Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
2;13;Stan;Oh, he's fine, dude.
2;13;Kyle;You think?
2;13;Cartman;Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
2;13;Stan;Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
2;13;;Back at the festivities, the Running of the Cows has ended, and Jimbo is onstage.
2;13;Jimbo;All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!
2;13;;The crowd stands silent.
2;13;Jimbo;Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.
2;13;;Nothing. Jimbo now looks around.
2;13;Jimbo;Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!
2;13;;People in the crowd start buzzing, as Officer Barbrady approaches Tom and Mary from behind.
2;13;Mary;Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists.
2;13;;Officer Barbrady cuffs them both and takes them away.
2;13;Mary;Oh my God!
2;13;;At the carnival, the boys have returned with Cartman.
2;13;Stan;How's he doing?
2;13;Kyle;He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
2;13;Cartman;Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
2;13;Stan;Do you think he can ride the bull?
2;13;Kyle;Yeah, I think so.
2;13;Stan;Cool.
2;13;;The boys pass by a man in uniform, and his wife.
2;13;Cartman;Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
2;13;Soldier;Huh?
2;13;Cartman;Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
2;13;Soldier;Go away, kid. You're grossing me out.
2;13;Cartman;Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
2;13;Soldier;Beat it, kid! Come on, honey.
2;13;;They walk away, an announcement over the loudspeaker gets the attention of carnival-goers.
2;13;Chamber of Farts Operator;Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!
2;13;;A crowd rushes to it, and Cartman is lost among the mass of people.
2;13;Stan;Jesus, dude!
2;13;Kyle;Hey, where's Cartman?
2;13;Stan;Oh, hell!
2;13;Kenny;(I don't know where he went!)
2;13;Stan;Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
2;13;Kenny;(Okay.)
2;13;;South Park Police Dept. Tom and Mary are still in jail, shivering and seemingly forgotten.
2;13;Tom;Hoh, it's so cold here.
2;13;Mary;Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
2;13;Tom;Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary.
2;13;Mary;You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
2;13;Tom;Yeah, and at least we've got our health.
2;13;;A rat runs by.
2;13;;Over at a ranch, two ranchers get out of a truck and walk into a field.
2;13;Grey Hat;I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it.
2;13;Mitchell;Where are they again?
2;13;Grey Hat;Just right up over this ridge.
2;13;;The ranchers reach the top of the ridge and look out over a large field full of cows gathered around the Cow Memorial, mooing. It is almost 9 a.m.
2;13;Grey Hat;That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time.
2;13;Mitchell;Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!
2;13;Grey Hat;[Ponders] Hmm. Cow cult.
2;13;;Back at the carnival, rodeo riders test their skill. One of them loses when his horse throws him off.
2;13;Announcer;The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!
2;13;Stan;Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
2;13;Kenny;(I don't know, can't find him.)
2;13;Kyle;He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
2;13;Kenny;(I know, I know!)
2;13;Cartman;[Off-camera.] Hello, prease! Hello!
2;13;Stan;[Points to him.] There he is!
2;13;;Cartman emerges from the crowd, now wearing a hot-pink two piece outfit, orange blush, and an oriental wig.
2;13;Cartman;Fucky-sucky, five dorrah.
2;13;;Back at the police station, Tom and Mary still sit and wait.
2;13;;Back on the hill, Jimbo and Ned have joined the two ranchers.
2;13;Grey Hat;Here they are, just like we told you.
2;13;;Jimbo has had enough of the Cows' shenanigans.
2;13;Jimbo;Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!
2;13;;The cows are unphased.
2;13;Jimbo;All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
2;13;;Ned lashes out his whip which makes a loud crack.
2;13;Ned;Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!
2;13;;He lashes out again and makes contact with a cow, this causes the herd to move in on him.
2;13;Ned;Bad cows stay! Stay!
2;13;;The cows are pissed. They rush in and trample him into the ground.
2;13;Ned;AAAAAH!
2;13;Jimbo;Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!
2;13;Grey Hat;[Still on the ridge, casually.] I reckon we should get some help.
2;13;Mitchell;I reckon.
2;13;;Back at the rodeo, the boys have Cartman on the bull, ready to ride.
2;13;Kyle;Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
2;13;Stan;Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
2;13;Cartman;Fucky-sucky five dollah.
2;13;Announcer;Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!
2;13;;The crowd cheers, and he removes his hat in appreciation.
2;13;Announcer;Three, two, one.
2;13;;The the gate opens and Jack goes forth.
2;13;Jack;Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!
2;13;;The bull finally throws him off. The crowd is silent and watches him sail through the air.
2;13;Jack;Aaaaaaaa!
2;13;;He lands, gored by another bull's horns, and dies.
2;13;Announcer;Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!
2;13;Cartman;Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
2;13;Announcer;Here we go!
2;13;Stan;Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
2;13;Kyle;What do you mean?
2;13;Stan;I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
2;13;Announcer;Let her go!
2;13;;"The gate thrusts open, and ""Ming Li"" goes forth."
2;13;Cartman;Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
2;13;Kyle;Hang on, Cartman!
2;13;Announcer;Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!
2;13;;Frank Hammond, his, partner, looks bored.
2;13;Announcer;I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean.
2;13;;Frank Hammond simply blinks.
2;13;Cartman;Aaah! Ten dorrah!
2;13;;Still riding the bull, the crowd cheers on.
2;13;Cartman;Ten dollah, soldier boy!
2;13;Announcer;She's setting a new world record!
2;13;;The crowd jumping up and down begin to chant.
2;13;Crowd;Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
2;13;;The bull finally bucks Cartman off.
2;13;Cartman;Gaaah!
2;13;;He ends up in the snow, where the bull comes and kicks him like a football.
2;13;Cartman;Heeee!
2;13;Stan;Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
2;13;Kyle;Go help him, Kenny!
2;13;;Kenny starts to climb over the fencing into the ring but has second thoughts.
2;13;Kenny;(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)
2;13;;The bull runs through the fence and away, taking Kenny with him. Stan and Kyle watch Kenny disappear.
2;13;Stan;Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
2;13;Kyle;You bastards!
2;13;;A rodeo clown picks Cartman up and carries him off.
2;13;Announcer;And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!
2;13;;His partner, rather disgusted, taps his mic until it falls.
2;13;Announcer;The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!
2;13;;The rodeo clown places Cartman in a barrel.
2;13;Cartman;Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
2;13;Stan;We did it, dude, we did it!
2;13;;Kyle smiles. Elsewhere, the cows are gathered again before the Memorial, about 3 p.m. Behind some large rocks, FBI agents pop up and take aim at the cows.
2;13;Agent;Freeze, cows!
2;13;;The cows look up, startled.
2;13;Agent;The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!
2;13;;Jimbo stands next to the agent. The cows ignore them.
2;13;Jimbo;You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
2;13;Agent;You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!
2;13;;Ned opens the back door to the trailer.
2;13;Agent;Move!
2;13;;The cows just look at them, then one of them walks forward and turns left, walking away.
2;13;Jimbo;Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!
2;13;;The cow walks to the edge of a cliff and looks back at them.
2;13;Agent;Oh, dear Jesus, no!
2;13;;The cow walks off the cliff, where it falls to its death.
2;13;Cow;Mooooo!
2;13;Jimbo;Nnoo!
2;13;;The other cows reach the cliff and walk off, one by one.
2;13;Jimbo;They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!
2;13;;Jimbo weeps into his hands.
2;13;Agent;This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
2;13;;South Park Police Station, Tom and Mary still wait in jail. Back at the carnival, the boys walk over to the Toss-A-Ball.
2;13;Toss-A-Ball Operator;Oh, you boys are back again, huh?
2;13;Stan;Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
2;13;Kyle;How many ball does that get us?
2;13;Cartman;[Still Ming Li.] Odline daur shunba shunba?
2;13;Toss-A-Ball Operator;Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Kyle;You will?
2;13;Stan;Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?
2;13;;The operator starts tossing down the dolls.
2;13;Kyle;We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
2;13;Cartman;Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?
2;13;Kyle;What are we gonna do with them?
2;13;;Stan begins to answer but before he can, the head of the Terrance doll which he is holding simply falls off.
2;13;Stan;We should-
2;13;;He looks down with Kyle at the head on the ground, horrified.
2;13;Kyle;..What the-?
2;13;Stan;Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!
2;13;;One of the Phillip doll's legs falls off.
2;13;Kyle;After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
2;13;;Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison, and a small crowd show up.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;What's all this?
2;13;Kyle;Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
2;13;Mr. Garrison;You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
2;13;Father Maxi;Yeah, and the food is terrible!
2;13;Chamber of Farts operator;Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?
2;13;;Everyone starts arguing all at once, except Barbrady and the boys.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
2;13;Townspeople;Yeah!
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
2;13;Line ride operator;..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!
2;13;;The town cheers, and some of the folks have brooms already. They gang up on the carnival people and beat them all for a long time. Stan and Kyle just watch.
2;13;;One in the afternoon. Jimbo, Ned, and some townsfolk are pushing the Cow Memorial back into the carnival area.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;You found it! You found the memorial!
2;13;Jimbo;Yeah.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;And the cows? Are they all back, too?
2;13;Jimbo;They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. [Sobs.]
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;What?!
2;13;Jimbo;Oho, it was awful! [Weeps.] Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
2;13;Jimbo;[Still sad.] I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger.
2;13;;Jimbo hears the commotion from the nearby crowd and perks up.
2;13;Jimbo;What's all the ruckus over there?
2;13;;He sees the townsfolk beating on the carnival people.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
2;13;Jimbo;Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
2;13;;Back at the police station.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- [Voice wavering.] Oooooh?
2;13;;Officer Barbrady notices the remains of Tom and Mary, who are no more. They've died of starvation and the rats have begun eating parts of them.
2;13;Jimbo;Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
2;13;Officer Barbrady;[Nervously.] Yeah.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Didn't we ever release them?
2;13;Jimbo;Aw, I forgot all about 'em.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Uh me, too.
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;I didn't?
2;13;Mayor McDaniels;No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
2;13;Officer Barbrady;Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
2;13;;The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are swimming in Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Stan;[With a Terrance doll.] Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
2;13;Kyle;[With a Phillip doll.] Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
2;13;Cartman;[Arrives, back to normal.] What are you guys doing?
2;13;Stan;Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
2;13;Cartman;Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
2;13;Kyle;Really? What about?
2;13;Cartman;Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.
2;13;;He notices the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
2;13;Cartman;Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
2;13;Stan;Oh-h. Nowhere.
2;13;;Stan and Kyle start giggling.
2;13;Cartman;Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
2;13;Kyle;No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
2;13;;A limousine pulls up and Leonardo DiCaprio is at the window.
2;13;Leonardo DiCaprio;Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again.
2;13;;Stan and Kyle laugh even harder, as the limo drives off.
2;13;Cartman;Oh! Son of a bitch!
