1;4;;Bus Stop.
1;4;Kyle;Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.
1;4;;A dog walks up to the boys.
1;4;Stan;Hiya, Sparky.
1;4;Kyle;[Looking] Who's that?
1;4;Stan;That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
1;4;Kyle;Wow! Cool!
1;4;Stan;Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?
1;4;Cartman;Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
1;4;Stan;He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
1;4;Cartman;No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
1;4;Sylvester;Arrrrrr.
1;4;Stan;He's not meaner than Sparky.
1;4;Cartman;Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
1;4;;Sylvester comes over.
1;4;Stan;Sparky'll kick his ass.
1;4;Cartman;I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
1;4;Kyle;You're on, dude!
1;4;;Sylvester starts after Sparky. Both dogs growl.
1;4;Stan;That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!
1;4;;Sparky lunges after Sylvester and out of view. Aggressive panting can be heard. The boys stand there, shocked.
1;4;Cartman;Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
1;4;Stan;Sparky! Bad dog!
1;4;Kenny;(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)
1;4;Stan;What?!
1;4;Cartman;Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
1;4;Stan;What do you mean?
1;4;Cartman;That dog is a gay homosexual.
1;4;;Stan looks back to study the situation, then...
1;4;Stan;He's just confused.
1;4;Kyle;I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
1;4;Kenny;(No, check his penis.)
1;4;;Kyle smiles.
1;4;Stan;Sick, shut up dude!
1;4;;Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away.
1;4;Cartman;Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
1;4;;The bus pulls up.
1;4;;Football Field, sideline before school.
1;4;Chef;Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park.
1;4;Kyle;Who's Middle Park?
1;4;Cartman;What's homecoming?
1;4;Chef;But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice.
1;4;;Chef blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field.
1;4;Pip;Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?
1;4;Chef;Yes Pip, what is it?
1;4;Pip;Uh, I still don't have a helmet.
1;4;Chef;I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
1;4;Pip;Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
1;4;Chef;Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.
1;4;Pip;Oh.
1;4;Chef;Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
1;4;;Out on the playing field.
1;4;Stan;Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
1;4;Chef;[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!
1;4;;Cartman hikes the ball over Stan's head. Stan chases it down. Kyle runs into Pip, opening a major gash on Pip's head.
1;4;Pip;Aaaaaaaargh!
1;4;;Jimbo and Ned arrive.
1;4;Jimbo;Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?
1;4;Chef;[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine.
1;4;Jimbo;I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
1;4;Chef;Elementary school alumni?
1;4;Jimbo;That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
1;4;Chef;I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
1;4;Jimbo;Middle Park by 70 points.
1;4;Chef;Hmmm...
1;4;;They look towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball.
1;4;Chef;I don't think we have a chance.
1;4;Jimbo;Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?
1;4;;Stan turns to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes.
1;4;Stan;Huh?
1;4;;The ball hits him on the side of the head. He picks it up and throws to Kyle.
1;4;Jimbo;Atta boy!
1;4;Chef;Great pass, Stan!
1;4;Jimbo;Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!
1;4;;On sideline after practice.
1;4;Chef;Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
1;4;Kyle;Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
1;4;Stan;Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
1;4;Clyde;Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
1;4;Stan;Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!
1;4;Clyde;Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
1;4;Cartman;There he goes again.
1;4;Stan;Get down, Sparky! Down!
1;4;Cartman;Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
1;4;Clyde;Make him stop!
1;4;;Rex moves away with his tail between his legs.
1;4;Rex;Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
1;4;;Fosse and Bill pass by laughing.
1;4;Fosse;I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
1;4;Bill;Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.
1;4;Fosse;Gay dog.
1;4;;The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting.
1;4;;Mr. Garrison's classroom. Start of school.
1;4;Cartman;...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.
1;4;Cartman;Ah, dammit!
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?
1;4;Mr. Hat;Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.
1;4;Stan;Um, I'm not really prepared either.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
1;4;Stan;Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Excellent. A-.
1;4;Cartman;Eeyy!
1;4;Stan;Wow, cool!
1;4;Cartman;Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people.
1;4;Cartman;That's not fair!
1;4;Mr. Hat;Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it.
1;4;Cartman;Stupid puppet.
1;4;;Dismissal bell rings.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
1;4;;All students except Stan leave the room.
1;4;Stan;Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Well of course Stanley, what is it?
1;4;Stan;What's a... homosexual?
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.
1;4;;Stan sits.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
1;4;Stan;I guess.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
1;4;;Bus stop. The boys get off the bus.
1;4;Cartman;You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
1;4;Kyle;You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
1;4;Cartman;Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
1;4;Stan;Shut up, dude!
1;4;;Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on.
1;4;Stan;Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
1;4;Sparky;Bark, bark.
1;4;Cartman;Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
1;4;Stan;He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.
1;4;;Sparky sits.
1;4;Stan;Good boy, now shake.
1;4;;Sparky shakes.
1;4;Stan;Good boy. Now, don't be gay.
1;4;;Stan waits for the command to sink in.
1;4;Stan;Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.
1;4;;Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls.
1;4;Kyle;Did it work?
1;4;Stan;I don't know.
1;4;Cartman;He still looks pretty gay to me.
1;4;Bill;Huh, huh.
1;4;Fosse;Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?
1;4;Bill;Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog.
1;4;Fosse;Gay dog.
1;4;Stan;Come on you guys, I have an idea.
1;4;;Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well.
1;4;Jimbo;I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
1;4;Bookie;Are you crazy?
1;4;Jimbo;No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
1;4;Gambler 1;I want to put all my money on the Cows.
1;4;Gambler 2;Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.
1;4;Gambler 3;Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.
1;4;Female Gambler 1;I got 500 on the Cows.
1;4;Female Gambler 2;Well, I'll put my money on the Cows.
1;4;Jimbo;Whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now uh...
1;4;Gambler 4;You better be right about this, Jimbo.
1;4;Jimbo;Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.
1;4;Ned;Are you sure Stan is that good?
1;4;Jimbo;Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
1;4;Bookie;You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
1;4;Ned;I love that song.
1;4;Jimbo;'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
1;4;;In front of Stan's house, a large crate sits next to the kids.
1;4;Stan;Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-
1;4;;Stan notices a pink scarf on Sparky.
1;4;Stan;Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!
1;4;;He grabs the scarf.
1;4;Stan;No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.
1;4;;The crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out.
1;4;Kyle;Ooh-la-la.
1;4;;Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her.
1;4;Cartman;There he goes!
1;4;Stan;Atta boy, Spark! Get her!
1;4;;Sparky climbs atop Fifi.
1;4;Stan;Yes!
1;4;;Sparky pulls Fifi's collar off and into the air, catching it around his neck.
1;4;Stan;Ah crap! Now what do I do?
1;4;Kyle;Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
1;4;Cartman;No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
1;4;Kenny;(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
1;4;Stan;I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
1;4;Kyle;Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
1;4;Stan;Like who?
1;4;;Inside Stan's house, Jesus and Pals' title screen is on TV.
1;4;TV Announcer;And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
1;4;Jesus Christ;Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
1;4;Robert;Yeah, is- is this Jesus?
1;4;Jesus;Yes my son.
1;4;Robert;This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.
1;4;Jesus;Of course Robert. How are things now?
1;4;Robert;Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins too, that was really nice of you.
1;4;Jesus;Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
1;4;Stan;Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
1;4;Jesus;My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
1;4;;The station's logo pops up.
1;4;TV Announcer;That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.
1;4;Stan;Damn it!
1;4;Kyle;What'd he say?
1;4;Stan;I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
1;4;Cartman;Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
1;4;Stan;Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
1;4;Kyle;Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
1;4;Stan;No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!
1;4;;Outside, Sparky overhears this.
1;4;Stan;I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
1;4;;Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone.
1;4;;On the sideline at practice.
1;4;Chef;"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]

Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
1;4;Kyle;Uh, Chef?
1;4;Chef;Spank it, ever so gently.
1;4;Kyle;Chef.
1;4;Chef;Spank it.
1;4;Kyle;Chef!
1;4;Chef;Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
1;4;Pip;Uh, Mr. Chef sir?
1;4;Chef;No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
1;4;Pip;Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
1;4;Chef;That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
1;4;Pip;No um, I guess not.
1;4;;Carl's Bombs And Explosives and Accessories.
1;4;Jimbo;What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
1;4;Carl;What moment would that be?
1;4;Jimbo;Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
1;4;Carl;What high F?
1;4;Jimbo;"You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah."
1;4;Carl;Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?
1;4;Jimbo;No, dammit! The aaaaah!
1;4;Carl;Aaaaahh?
1;4;Ned;Aaaaahh.
1;4;Jimbo;Aaaaahh!
1;4;Carl;Aaaaahh.
1;4;Jimbo;Great.
1;4;Carl;Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
1;4;Ned;Doo-nn-doo-doo
1;4;Jimbo;You got it.
1;4;Carl;Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
1;4;Ned;Aaa - dooo...
1;4;Jimbo;Aaaaahh!
1;4;Carl;Alright, yeah, okay...
1;4;;On the sideline at practice.
1;4;Chef;What's the matter, Stan? You seem down.
1;4;Stan;I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
1;4;Chef;Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
1;4;;Coming up to see what's the matter.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
1;4;Chef;Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;What do you mean?
1;4;Chef;Well, you're gay aren't you?
1;4;Mr. Garrison;What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
1;4;Chef;Well, you sure do act like it.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass.
1;4;;Chef looks puzzled, wondering.
1;4;;On the field.
1;4;;Kyle runs up from behind.
1;4;Kyle;What's the matter dude?
1;4;Stan;I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
1;4;Cartman;Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
1;4;;Snowy mountains. Sparky is trekking through the snow, stops, and looks around. A floating castle nears him. It's Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.
1;4;;Sparky looks at him.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Have you been outcast?
1;4;;Sparky pants an affirmative.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?
1;4;;Sparky pants an affirmative.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.
1;4;;Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman are at the Bus Stop. Stan walks up.
1;4;Stan;Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
1;4;Kyle;Wow, it's been like two days.
1;4;Stan;I think he might've run away.
1;4;Cartman;Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
1;4;Kyle;We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan.
1;4;Stan;I'm not playing.
1;4;Kyle;You what?!
1;4;Stan;I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
1;4;;Middle Park Elementary School.
1;4;Jimbo;[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet.
1;4;Ned;[louder] Okay.
1;4;;They climb over the fence and approach the Middle Park mascot, a horse.
1;4;Jimbo;Hello there, Enrique.
1;4;Ned;What are we doing here?
1;4;Jimbo;Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead.
1;4;;Jimbo puts the bomb on Enrique's back.
1;4;Jimbo;"And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in ""Loving You"", BOOM!"
1;4;;Enrique gets wide-eyed.
1;4;Jimbo;No more Middle Park players!
1;4;;Jimbo and Ned laugh, and Enrique starts to tremble.
1;4;Jimbo;God damn, I love football!
1;4;;Stan is in the stormy mountains.
1;4;Stan;Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
1;4;;South Park Elementary.
1;4;;The Middle Park Cowboys exit the bus.
1;4;Cowboys;Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
1;4;;South Park Football Field. The bleachers are filled with fans decked out in COWS! gear. Even Ike is wearing a GO COWS shirt and bouncing about.
1;4;Frank Hammond;Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.
1;4;;Pounds the table, and Phil's mike falls over. He scans the sidelines.
1;4;Frank;Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.
1;4;Chef;[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan...
1;4;Pip;Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
1;4;Chef;No Pip, I'm sorry!
1;4;;Stormy mountains.
1;4;Stan;Sparky! Sparky!
1;4;;South Park Football Field, first quarter. The game is about to begin.
1;4;Referee;Play ball.
1;4;Chef;You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
1;4;Kyle;But I never practiced quarterback.
1;4;Chef;Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
1;4;Frank;Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Hey hey, where is little Stanley?
1;4;Mr. Hat;Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?
1;4;Jimbo;Ned, look!
1;4;;Middle Park's mascot, Enrique, is shown.
1;4;Jimbo;They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
1;4;Ned;Yay.
1;4;;Stan follows his dog's footprints and finds himself facing Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Hi little fella, how are you doing today?
1;4;Stan;Fine, how are you?
1;4;Big Gay Al;I'm super, thanks for asking.
1;4;Stan;My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]
1;4;Stan;Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
1;4;Big Gay Al;We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
1;4;Gay Lion;Rooaar.
1;4;Big Gay Al;And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!
1;4;Stan;Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?
1;4;;They enter the techno-dance floor as disco music plays. Animals pour in to dance, even a dolphin on its tail.
1;4;Vocalist;Oww, we can both be gay!
1;4;;In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss.
1;4;Kyle;Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!
1;4;Huddle;Break!
1;4;;At the line of scrimmage.
1;4;Cowboy 1;You guys are toast.
1;4;Cowboy 2;Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
1;4;Cartman;We'll just see about that.
1;4;Kyle;Set, set.
1;4;;Cartman farts long and nasty right into Kyle's face. Kyle quickly retreats.
1;4;Kyle;Damn it Cartman!
1;4;Chef;What's the matter?
1;4;Kyle;Cartman farted!
1;4;Cartman;No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
1;4;Chef;Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
1;4;Kyle;No way dude!
1;4;Chef;Hike! The! Ball!
1;4;;Kyle is back in position, with his shirt covering his nose.
1;4;Kyle;Ah, dude, weak.
1;4;Cartman;That's right, you get back there.
1;4;Kyle;Hike!
1;4;Frank;Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
1;4;;Screaming as Kyle is tackled.
1;4;Frank;Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.
1;4;Jimbo;Hell's bells.
1;4;Frank;Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.
1;4;;Phil quickly covers the mic.
1;4;Phil;Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.
1;4;Frank;Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.
1;4;Townsman 1;We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.
1;4;Jimbo;Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh.
1;4;;Big Gay Al's Big Gay Dance Floor.
1;4;Vocalist;...both be gay.
1;4;;Stan is dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky.
1;4;Stan;Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
1;4;Sparky;Ruff.
1;4;Stan;I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
1;4;Sparky;Barr.
1;4;Stan;Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.
1;4;;Sparky follows Stan.
1;4;Stan;We can work on making you not gay together.
1;4;;Sparky stops and sits.
1;4;Stan;Sparky?
1;4;Big Gay Al;Young man, it appears you still don't understand.
1;4;Stan;What don't I understand?
1;4;Big Gay Al;Come this way, I have to show you something.
1;4;;South Park Football Field, second quarter.
1;4;Frank;With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.
1;4;Kyle;Hut, hut.
1;4;;Cartman snaps the ball to Kyle. The Cowboys blitz. Kyle flips the ball back to Pip, who is still without a helmet. The Cowboys players descend on him as soon as he catches the ball.
1;4;Frank;Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.
1;4;;Phil muffles Frank.
1;4;Phil;Dude! Now that is not cool.
1;4;Frank;Sorry, sorry.
1;4;;Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.
1;4;;Stan looks at the boat.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Step aboard, Stanley.
1;4;;He and Sparky step aboard the boat.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.
1;4;;South Park Football Field. South Park's final drive before the halftime show.
1;4;Frank;And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
1;4;;The Cowboys kick off.
1;4;Frank;There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.
1;4;;Kenny weaves through the special teams.
1;4;Frank;He's at the 50, the 40, the 30.
1;4;Cowboys;Hold him, hold him!
1;4;;Two of them take hold of Kenny's arms.
1;4;Cowboys;Hold him, hold him!
1;4;Cowboy;Yaaah!
1;4;;A Third Cowboy dives in, taking Kenny's head off, as the other two sever Kenny's arms.
1;4;Frank;The little running back is down. I think he's...
1;4;;Rats come in to devour Kenny's corpse.
1;4;Frank;Yes, he's been decapitated.
1;4;Kyle;[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
1;4;Phil;Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank.
1;4;Frank;Ouch-a-roo!
1;4;Chef;Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!
1;4;Frank;Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot.
1;4;;Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
1;4;;The boat-ride begins the passage through several animatronic scenes.
1;4;Big Gay Al;You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.
1;4;;The tips of the Japanese soldiers' swords touch.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!
1;4;;Big Gay Al fires off a shot with his pistol.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely.
1;4;;Doors open to reveal a scene reminiscent of 'It's a Small World'.
1;4;Boat Ride Singers;"We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!"
1;4;Big Gay Al;Sooo, what do you think, Stan?
1;4;;"Still singing.
...It's okay to be gay..."
1;4;Stan;This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand.
1;4;;"Still singing.
It's okay to be gay. Shalala waylaylay shalala waylaylay. It's okay to be gay."
1;4;Big Gay Al;[to himself] Isn't this precious?
1;4;;South Park Football Field. Halftime.
1;4;Frank;And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother...
1;4;Audience Member;Alright Richard!
1;4;;Music starts up.
1;4;Richard Stamos;"Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-n-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!"
1;4;;His voice cracks and the music stops.
1;4;Richard;Aaaaah!
1;4;Jimbo;What the hell?!
1;4;Richard;Aaaaah!
1;4;;His voice wavers.
1;4;Jimbo;He didn't sing the high F!
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
1;4;Jimbo;Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
1;4;Richard;Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...
1;4;Mr. Garrison;[heckling] It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
1;4;;Outside of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
1;4;Stan;Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!
1;4;Sparky;Ruff!
1;4;Big Gay Al;No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?
1;4;Stan;No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!
1;4;;They start to walk off.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Oh Stan?
1;4;;They stop.
1;4;Big Gay Al;When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately.
1;4;Stan;I will Big Gay Al, I will.
1;4;;They depart.
1;4;;Bell dings.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]
1;4;;South Park Football Field, fourth quarter.
1;4;Kyle;Hike!
1;4;Frank;And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
1;4;Mr. Garrison;I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo.
1;4;Mr. Hat;Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.
1;4;Townsman;You're a dead man, Jimbo!
1;4;;A hail of food products is thrown at Jimbo.
1;4;Frank;Well, this should just about wrap it up for-
1;4;;Stan and Sparky come onto the field.
1;4;Frank;Wait a minute, what's this?
1;4;Jimbo;Yeah! Yohooooh!
1;4;Frank;It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!
1;4;Chef;Where the hell have you been Stan?!
1;4;Stan;I've been getting my best friend back.
1;4;Chef;Just get in there boy!
1;4;Jimbo;Give 'em hell, Stanley!
1;4;;Stan takes his place on the field as Jimbo looks to the heavens, and prays aloud to himself.
1;4;Jimbo;Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
1;4;;In the first row of the stands.
1;4;Jesus;Leave me alone.
1;4;Stan;Hike!
1;4;Frank;Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
1;4;Kyle;Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!
1;4;Stan;Mph!
1;4;;Stan throws the ball.
1;4;Frank;And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!
1;4;Kyle;Oof.
1;4;;Kyle runs towards the end zone, panting, Cowboys hot on his trail.
1;4;Frank;Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!
1;4;;Frank recoils.
1;4;Phil;Dude!
1;4;;The crowd cheers as Kyle scores.
1;4;Frank;Touchdown!
1;4;Jimbo;Yeah! Wooo!
1;4;Frank;The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!
1;4;;Frank swats his mic away.
1;4;Jimbo;Yeah! Woohoo!
1;4;;Postgame press conference. Stan gets on stage by scoreboard.
1;4;Townsman;Speech!
1;4;Frank;Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?
1;4;Stan;Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
1;4;Crowd;Yeah, alright!
1;4;Stan;And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
1;4;Crowd;Wooooh!
1;4;Stan;And it's okay to be gay!
1;4;;The crowd falls silent.
1;4;Jimbo;What?!
1;4;Stan;Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;What the hell is he talking about?
1;4;Frank;Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?
1;4;Stan;I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.
1;4;;The crowd looks at Stan in disbelief.
1;4;Stan;It's true, I'll show you.
1;4;;At the site of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. There is nothing to be seen.
1;4;Stan;But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
1;4;Cartman;Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
1;4;;The missing animals suddenly appear.
1;4;Townswoman;Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
1;4;Townsperson 1;Sidney!
1;4;Townsperson 2;Willy!
1;4;Townsperson 3;Carlos!
1;4;;Big Gay Al is suddenly at Stan's side.
1;4;Big Gay Al;I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
1;4;Stan;Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
1;4;Big Gay Al;I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.
1;4;;He pops his suitcase open and climbs into it.
1;4;Big Gay Al;Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.
1;4;;He presses a button, and the suitcase closes.
1;4;Stan;Wow!
1;4;;The suitcase flies off.
1;4;Richard;You guys, you guys! I can do it.
1;4;Mr. Garrison;Do what?
1;4;Richard;"Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo"
1;4;Jimbo;No!
1;4;Richard;Aaah!
1;4;Enrique;Mroo-
1;4;;BOOM!
