7;5;;South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at one end of the basketball court.
7;5;Kyle;[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]
7;5;Principal Victoria;[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.
7;5;Mr. Mackey;[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]
7;5;Kyle;Cool.
7;5;Principal Victoria;All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]
7;5;Cartman;[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
7;5;Kids;Jennifer Lopez?
7;5;Kyle;No way.
7;5;Cartman;[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]
7;5;Principal Victoria;[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.
7;5;Cartman;Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.
7;5;Cartman;Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh si si si. I like it very much.
7;5;Cartman;[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Saright.
7;5;Cartman;That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!
7;5;Cartman;Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.

7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Hennifer Lopez. [members of the council laugh and clap]
7;5;A Council Member;Hahahahaha, oh my.
7;5;Cartman;Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.
7;5;Cartman;And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]
7;5;;South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down one side inside the mall. Cartman leads the way.
7;5;Cartman;Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
7;5;Kyle;It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
7;5;Cartman;Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
7;5;Kyle;No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
7;5;Cartman;[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Aww, that makes me muy triste.
7;5;Cartman;Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh si si, very much.
7;5;Cartman;Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]
7;5;Cartman;Is nice?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]
7;5;Kyle;[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!
7;5;Cartman;Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
7;5;Kenny;(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]
7;5;;South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down the mall. Cartman's hand is finishing off a taco as he looks at it.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Mmm, tacos! So yummy!
7;5;Kyle;Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
7;5;Cartman;Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
7;5;Kyle;She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!
7;5;Kenny;(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a ""U R Da Star"", a music-video shop]"
7;5;Kyle;Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
7;5;Cartman;I agree. Those places are stupid.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;It's not stupid. I need to make music video.
7;5;Stan;[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
7;5;Cartman;Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;[rises] Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is. [leads Cartman in. Stan and Kenny follow]
7;5;Kyle;God dammit! [follows reluctantly]
7;5;Michael;Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;How much to make a video?
7;5;Michael;Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
7;5;Cartman;Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh please! Come on, guys!
7;5;Kyle;Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
7;5;Cartman;All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]
7;5;Kyle;That's not what I meant!
7;5;Michael;All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Something hot and spicy.
7;5;;The cashier puts on various music tracks, first song is a rock song.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Spicier.
7;5;;Next is Latin song
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Spicierrr!
7;5;;Next song is a Latin mix. This is agreeable, so the video is made.
7;5;;"""Jennifer Lopez: Taco-Flavored Kisses"" is shown, The hand has its costume on hanging down from it."
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.

Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco."
7;5;Michael;You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"Oh, gracias, ""Machel""! [the cashier's tag reads ""Michael""]"
7;5;Michael;Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!
7;5;Kyle;Can we go now, please?!
7;5;Cartman;Yeah, I wanna leave.
7;5;Kyle;Stop it, Cartman!
7;5;Cartman;What?

7;5;BHI President;She's fantastic. Who is she? [two men sit on a sofa, one sits on an armchair]
7;5;Aide 1;[with brown hair] Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez.
7;5;Aide 2;[in armchair] That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.
7;5;BHI President;Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
7;5;Aide 2;I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
7;5;BHI President;No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
7;5;;Cartman's house, day. The phone rings in the kitchen and he answers it.
7;5;Cartman;"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to ""her""]"
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh, si si siiih. Allo!
7;5;Cartman;What do they want?

7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh, si si siiih.
7;5;Cartman;[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.

7;5;Man 2;Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!
7;5;Man 3;Jennifer, over here.
7;5;Man 4;Jennifer!

7;5;BHI President;Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where is she come from?!

7;5;BHI President;Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on.
7;5;Aide 2;Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
7;5;;A limousine, from the back seat. A small TV is on near the floor, behind the driver.
7;5;Reporter;And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
7;5;Ben;[sitting at the other end of the passenger cabin] Huhuhuh, that's me. [a door opens opposite him and J-Lo enters] How'd it go, baby?
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez! [her dog begins to bark] Shut up! [a few more barks and she tosses it out the window.]
7;5;Ben;What?? Who could replace you??

7;5;Mr. Mackey;Here she comes! Here she comes!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!
7;5;Principal Victoria;[Mr. Adler takes a picture] J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[begins pacing] No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck! [reaches the other end of the crowd] So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?! You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again! [walks away]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;[a few seconds later...] You can suck my culo, chica! [Cartman looks up, stunned, as Jennifer Lopez returns to the crowd]
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[looks around] Who was that?! [all the kids back away from Cartman while pointing at him] You go' a problem?!
7;5;Cartman;Not me!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Then who? [Cartman brings out his hand and points to it with the other]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Hola, bitchola! [Cartman is looking ever more fearful]
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;What the hell is that?!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos.
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;That? That's what replaced me?!
7;5;Cartman;I'm sure it was just a mistake.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!
7;5;Cartman;Shut your God-damned mouth!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[picks Cartman up by the scruff of his jacket] You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!
7;5;Cartman;Nobody!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Fuck you! [begins to assault Cartman's hand]
7;5;Cartman;Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;You'd better stop!
7;5;Cartman;I will!

7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!
7;5;;She drags him off, but he glances back at the new Jennifer Lopez. He follows the original Lopez into the limousine, looking back one more time. As the limo leaves, Ben looks back one more time with his hands up against the glass as if blowing a kiss. The crowd then disperses.
7;5;Kyle;Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
7;5;Cartman;Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
7;5;Kyle;Good.

7;5;Cartman;[real tired] He-yesss.
7;5;Ben;Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.
7;5;Cartman;[hides his left hand] She's not here right now.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;[muffled] Ben? Is that my darling Ben?
7;5;Ben;Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her! [Cartman sighs deeply, then shows his hand to Ben]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Ben!!! Oh, you brought me roses!
7;5;Ben;Jenny, ah Jenny I just can't stop thinking about you. [lowers the bouquet to Cartman, who takes it away angrily]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!
7;5;Ben;I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.
7;5;Ben;Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?

7;5;Cartman;I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Okay, Ben, let's go!
7;5;;A mountain road. Ben and Cartman drive along at a fast clip.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze blowing through my hair in your sexy automobile.
7;5;Ben;Let's spend the whole day together!
7;5;;"A soft song plays. The next scene is a dawn on a beach, where ""Jennifer Lopez"" and Ben run side by side. Cartman looks tired. Next is a restaurant where Ben has some wine while ""Jennifer Lopez"" enjoys a martini. Next scene, they're watching a movie together. ""Jennifer Lopez"" has her own seat between Ben and Cartman. Bem stretches and puts his hand on the headrest behind ""Jennifer Lopez"". Cartman looks, then looks away angrily. Next scene is at a jewelry store, where Ben picks out some earrings for ""Jennifer Lopez"". ""Jennifer Lopez"" opens her mouth in delight and Ben smiles. Next scene, Ben is resting on Cartman's lap and chatting with ""Jennifer Lopez"". Again, Cartman looks away in disgust. Last scene is undercover photos taken of Ben and ""Jennifer Lopez"", which end up on The National Inquisition."

7;5;Ben;But what?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?
7;5;Ben;[pulls off to the side, with South Park in view.] I still care for her. Maybe I always will. But... You just have so much more going on. Up here. [strokes the top of Cartman's hand]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh Ben. Beennn.

7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me! [Cartman looks in wonder as his hand gets a mind of its own]
7;5;Cartman;"Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to ""Jennifer Lopez"" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude!"
7;5;Ben;Mmm, just like tacos.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.
7;5;Ben;You're so hot, baby.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I make you hot, Ben?

7;5;Ben;Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I love you, Ben!
7;5;;"Music Lab Recording Studio, night. ""Jennifer Lopez"" is recording new tracks. Cartman is practically sleeping on the job as his hand belts out new tunes."
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.
Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP!"
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"[the band stops playing] What the hell is wrong with you?! You cholos can't even keep a beat! I deserve better than thees! I an Hennifer Lopez! Where is my water?! [a page brings ""her"" a bottle of water. ""Jennifer Lopez"" knocks it onto the floor] Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!"
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
7;5;Aide 2;Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Fine my ass, cholo! [Cartman wakes up and looks at his hand] I'll tell you when it's fine!
7;5;;Music Lab Recording Studio, night, back entrance. Cartamn exits and goes down three steps.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?! [a bat hits a car nearby]
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[stands next to the car she just bashed] You little snot-nose! [Cartman is taken aback] You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! [holds up the tabloid shown earlier]
7;5;Cartman;Aww crap.
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;You'd better stay away from him! [begins whacking away at Cartman's hand]
7;5;Cartman;OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
7;5;;Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. Dr. Doctor is showing Liane, Cartman's mother, an X-ray of her son's hand.
7;5;Dr. Doctor;Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
7;5;Liane;Oh dear.
7;5;Dr. Doctor;But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;[on its own hospital bed, with wires attached] Ahhh Ahhhh [Cartman sits in a chair displeased]
7;5;Cartman;I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh, hello guys.
7;5;Kyle;Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?
7;5;Cartman;Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
7;5;Kyle;I hate you. [turns right and walks out]
7;5;Liane;Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
7;5;;Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows. Cartman, asleep, stretches and wakes up, then glances to his left.
7;5;Cartman;EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]
7;5;Liane;[enters with a cup of coffee and wearing a pink robe] What is it, sweetie?
7;5;Cartman;Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
7;5;Liane;Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you.[backs out of the room and closes the door.]
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Buenos dias, my love.
7;5;Ben;Good morning, baby.
7;5;Cartman;You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
7;5;Cartman;What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
7;5;Ben;Should we tell him the news?
7;5;Cartman;What news?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I think we should tell him.
7;5;Ben;It's S'aright?
7;5;Cartman;S'aright.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;S'aright.
7;5;Ben;We're getting married!!
7;5;Cartman;Oh, balls!
7;5;;Kyle's house, day. He, Stan and Kenny watch TV on the couch. The doorbell rings.
7;5;Kyle;Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]
7;5;Cartman;[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you.
7;5;Stan;What's the matter?
7;5;Cartman;I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
7;5;Kyle;So stop doing it!
7;5;Cartman;Stop doing what?
7;5;Kyle;You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
7;5;Cartman;"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and ""Jennifer Lopez"" emerges coughing]"
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
7;5;Kyle;Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
7;5;Kyle;I can see your lips moving!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;I can see your lips moving too, culo!
7;5;Kyle;See?! I just saw your lips move!
7;5;Cartman;Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
7;5;Stan;What's she doing?
7;5;Kyle;Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
7;5;Stan;I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
7;5;Kyle;"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"""
7;5;Stan;Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us look dumb?
7;5;Kyle;YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]
7;5;Stan;Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
7;5;Cartman;Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Oh no you don't!
7;5;Cartman;Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
7;5;Kyle;Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]
7;5;Cartman;Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]
7;5;;Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something.
7;5;Ben;There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]
7;5;Aide 1;Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]
7;5;Ben;Don't you hurt her!
7;5;BHI President;We'll sue you!
7;5;Kyle;Oh Jesus.
7;5;;A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers draw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable.
7;5;Police officer 1;Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]
7;5;Aide 1;Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]
7;5;Police officer 2;All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
7;5;Ben;"[rushes up to ""Jennifer Lopez""] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!"
7;5;Aide 2;Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]
7;5;Ben;Our love is like rain!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;That's what you said about me, asshole!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Quiet!
7;5;BHI President;Get her out of here!
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Fuck you!
7;5;Police officer 2;Shut up, picante pants!
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
7;5;BHI President;You're not?
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Conner. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]
7;5;Police officer 2;Who's Mitch Conner?
7;5;Mitch Conner;Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.
7;5;Kyle;[exasperated] Oh no, no, no.
7;5;Mitch Conner;I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.
7;5;Kyle;Stop. It.
7;5;Mitch Conner;Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]
7;5;Police officer 2;Well, looks like Mitch Conner has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]
7;5;Kyle;[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner?
7;5;Cartman;I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
7;5;Kyle;[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible.
7;5;Cartman;[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
7;5;;A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar.
7;5;Manager;Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!
7;5;Manager;Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;Get a what with who?
7;5;Manager;Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
7;5;Jennifer Lopez;[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
7;5;Coworker;Yeah. Meee too.
7;5;Cartman as Jennifer Lopez;"[as credits roll]
