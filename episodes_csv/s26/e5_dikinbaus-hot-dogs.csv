26;5;;The four boys are playing basketball, when Butters runs up to them.
26;5;Butters;Fellas! Hey, fellas, you're not gonna believe it!
26;5;Cartman;Butters, what the hell are you wearing?
26;5;Butters;I got a job over at the ice cream shop! Guess what? I got my very first paycheck!
26;5;Cartman;That's not fair! I want a paycheck!
26;5;Butters;My dad told me if I got a job, we could put my paychecks in my very own bank account.
26;5;Cartman;I want a bank account!
26;5;Stan;I didn't know kids could get jobs.
26;5;Butters;Yeah, well, I guess these days it's really hard for businesses to find people to work, so they'll take whatever they can get.
26;5;Cartman;I want to take whatever I can get!
26;5;Butters;It's what they call the Great Resignation Labor Shortage. So now, if you have your parents' permission, there are some jobs they'll even let kids do.
26;5;Cartman;That is messed up! Why does he get to have a job? I want a job!
26;5;Kyle;You wouldn't last four hours on a job, fatass.
26;5;Cartman;Excuse me? That's easy for you to say! You don't need a job, 'cause you live in a nice house! I have to live in a shithole like Kenny does! It's not fair that some people in our country are given the opportunity for employment, while others aren't!
26;5;;Cartman starts to leave.
26;5;Cartman;I'm gonna tell my mom!
26;5;;Cartman leaves.
26;5;;Scene cuts to Cartman's house, where Liane is on the couch watching TV and knitting. Cartman enters.
26;5;Cartman;Mom! Mom! I need your permission to get a job.
26;5;Liane;Oh, you're too young to have a job, sweetie!
26;5;Cartman;Butters got a job!
26;5;;Liane ignores Cartman.
26;5;Cartman;Mom! Look at this shithole we live in! Somebody has to get a job, 'cause you just sit on your ass all day!
26;5;Liane;I had a job, Eric, but you got me fired because you wanted me taking care of you, and that's why we had to sell our house!
26;5;Cartman;Yes! Right! Because I'm the man of the house. You're supposed to take care of me, and I'm supposed to go get a job. You really expect us to live like this the rest of our lives? This is not a proper place to raise a child! You have to go let me find a job, Mom!
26;5;Liane;Eric, the truth is, I don't think you'd last four hours at a job.
26;5;Cartman;Oh! Now you sound like Kyle! Do you run Hollywood with him? Are you a Jew too, Mom?
26;5;Liane;Alright, Eric, fine! You want to go get a job and have a little dose of reality? Maybe it'll be good for you.
26;5;Cartman;Thanks, Mom! I love you!
26;5;;Cartman leaves.
26;5;;Scene cuts to the ice cream store where Butters is working.
26;5;Butters;Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream. Loo, loo, loo, you'll eat it too. Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream...
26;5;;Butters goes to the checkout counter and hands ice cream to a customer.
26;5;Butters;Okay, and the pistachio maple cream. Let me know if you need extra napkins for your table, and have a creamy day!
26;5;;Cartman enters the store.
26;5;Butters;Oh, hey, Eric!
26;5;Cartman;Hey, Butters! I'm here for my job.
26;5;Butters;What are you talking about?
26;5;Cartman;"My mom gave me permission; I can start work now. What do I do?"
26;5;Butters;Well, but, Eric, this is my job.
26;5;Cartman;Yeah, I want your job, sitting around eating ice cream. Sounds fun.
26;5;Butters;Eric, there's a lot more to it than that, and I already do this job, so...
26;5;Manager;Everything alright, Butters?
26;5;Butters;Oh. Yes, Mr. Sullivan. I was just...
26;5;Cartman;Hello, sir. I'm a dear friend of Butters. He told me all about this place and said I should get permission from my mom to work here.
26;5;Manager;Oh. Well, uh, I do need all the help I can get. Butters, can you vouch for him? Is he trustworthy and reliable?
26;5;Butters;Uh, oh, uh...
26;5;;Cartman glares at Butters.
26;5;Butters;Um, okay.
26;5;Manager;Alright, well, let's find him a uniform, and you can start training him.
26;5;Cartman;Hey, man! I got a job!
26;5;;"Title card: ""1:43 PM"", ""13 MINUTES INTO JOB"""
26;5;Butters;Alright, Eric. So there's three types of ice cream: waffle cone, sugar cone, and cups.
26;5;Cartman;Uh-huh, and when do we get to have breaks?
26;5;Butters;Well, you get a ten-minute break every two hours, but only after you check all the freezers, which are right over there, and need to always be set to 0Â°.
26;5;Cartman;Okay, and how much longer do we have to be here?
26;5;Butters;Eric, please, I don't want to lose this job...
26;5;;A customer walks in.
26;5;Butters;Oh. Hello, sir. Hope you're having a creamy day. What can I get for you?
26;5;Customer;Can I have a single scoop of coconut almond fudge?
26;5;Butters;Okay. Eric, can you scoop out some coconut almond fudge?
26;5;Cartman;Why?
26;5;Butters;Because it's your job, Eric.
26;5;Cartman;Whoa, Butters. Let's not make this a toxic work environment, okay?
26;5;Butters;One second, sir. I'll get that scoop.
26;5;;"Title card: ""2:07 PM"", ""37 MINUTES INTO JOB"""
26;5;Cartman;[on the phone] Yeah, I got a job in an ice cream shop. Yeah, it's dumb as hell, but I'm going to start getting paychecks.
26;5;Manager;Butters, what is this about?
26;5;Butters;Oh, sorry, sir. Eric?
26;5;Cartman;Yeah, I know. She's pretty hot, but she's got droopy boobs.
26;5;Butters;Eric! Eric, you can't just sit there at a table.
26;5;Cartman;[to Butters] Yeah, I can. It's Monday.
26;5;Butters;So?
26;5;Cartman;So haven't you heard of Bare Minimum Mondays? It's a thing that young people created because we care about our mental health.
26;5;Butters;I don't care if it's Bare Minimum Monday! Eric, you need to...
26;5;;Cartman's phone beeps.
26;5;Cartman;Oh, break time. I'll be back.
26;5;;"Title card: ""3:15 PM"", ""1.2 HOURS INTO JOB"""
26;5;;The line of customers is out the door. Butters is visibly stressed from working.
26;5;Manager;Butters! Butters, we got a line out the door. People are getting upset.
26;5;Butters;I know, sir. I'm sorry.
26;5;Manager;Well, where is your friend?
26;5;Butters;He hasn't come back from his break yet.
26;5;Child;Butters Stotch?
26;5;Butters;Yes?
26;5;Child;Delivery for you.
26;5;;"The child hands Butters a laptop with a note that says ""OPEN ME""."
26;5;;Butters opens the laptop, to reveal Cartman on video call.
26;5;Cartman;Hey, Butters!
26;5;Butters;Ah! Eric, where are you?
26;5;Cartman;I wasn't feeling the best so I decided to work from home.
26;5;Manager;Butters, what's going on?
26;5;Butters;Uh, Eric says he's going to work from home.
26;5;Manager;How can he work from home? This is an ice cream shop!
26;5;Cartman;Yeah, no, 'cause see, I'm actually taking a mental health day. Yeah, young people can just ask for a mental health day and employers can't deny them. It's my mental health day.
26;5;Butters;Eric, you need to come here right now or we're both gonna get fired!
26;5;Cartman;Okay, I guess so. But don't forget that tomorrow is Take-it-Easy Tuesday.
26;5;;"Title card: ""4:32 PM"", ""3 HOURS AND 2 MINUTES INTO JOB..."""
26;5;Butters;Okay, thanks for coming, and have a creamy day.
26;5;Butters;Hi, hope you're having a creamy day. Can I help you?
26;5;Cartman;You know what's total bullcrap, Butters? It's how much money the owner of this place is making while we're out here busting our asses. I mean, what does that old fart even do?
26;5;Butters;Eric, could you please fill this nice lady's order?
26;5;Cartman;Oh, yes, let me get that for you, master, right away now.
26;5;Cartman;I mean, seriously, Butters, why do we have to work for the owner? We know how to do all this stuff now. We don't even need that guy. There has to be a way we could turn the tables. There has to be a way we could make all the money.

26;5;;Cartman barges in.
26;5;Cartman;Kenny!
26;5;Kenny;(Jesus Christ, dude!)
26;5;Cartman;Kenny! Kenny, you're not going to believe this, but I just quit my job.
26;5;Kenny;(You had a job?)
26;5;Cartman;Yes, I had a job. But I got fed up, sick of working my fingers to the bone for some piece-of-shit owner. And that's when it hit me. Kenny, we should open a restaurant.
26;5;Kenny;(Why the fuck would we open a restaurant?)
26;5;Cartman;You know the hot dog I've been living in? It's an old, like, historic landmark. It's been sitting right in front of us completely ready to go! All it would take is some minor renovations and some care. We can make it awesome with, like, fun things for kids to do, and rides and games. A place that people from all over Colorado would want to come and see! And we would be the owners. And we could have all the hot dogs we wanted.
26;5;Kenny;(Whoa.)
26;5;Cartman;Aren't you sick of living like this, Kenny? All we need is an investor, and we can make our dreams come true. And I know somebody who has a bank account and gets paychecks every week.
26;5;;Scene cuts to the bank. Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and a banker are meeting.
26;5;Butters;No. No, no, no. Thank you, no.
26;5;Cartman;Butters, don't you want to invest your money in something that matters? That's why we came to your bank to offer you this awesome deal.
26;5;Banker;What we can do, Eric, is set up a line of credit for an LLC which then pays you back not only your investment, but also principal in the company.
26;5;Butters;But I like my ice cream job. I don't want to open a hot dog.
26;5;Cartman;No, you keep working at the ice cream shop. We're going to open the hot dog. All you do is collect the money as the investor.
26;5;Butters;Yeah, but this is my money. I worked hard for it.
26;5;Cartman;Butters, it's just like... You're lucky, you know? You have money. But look at Kenny. Can you imagine what it's like for him watching rich white boys like you just collecting paycheck after paycheck, while he wallows in the filth of his tiny house?
26;5;Kenny;(The fuck?)
26;5;Cartman;Butters, Kenny deserves a chance to be able to work like you do. Please, give him that chance.
26;5;Butters;Uh, I just give a bit of my paycheck every week to you guys?
26;5;Cartman;And we pay you back as soon as we make our first dollar, Butters. You have my word on it.
26;5;Butters;Oh, okay.
26;5;Cartman;Yeah!
26;5;Kenny;(Yeah!)
26;5;Cartman;Guys, we're going into the restaurant business.

26;5;;Scene cuts to news reporter standing outside of restaurant.
26;5;Reporter;Tom, I'm standing out front of a Colorado icon: the old Coney Island Hot Dog, where the owners plan to reopen soon. The hot dog stand is going through major renovations and the new name has just been announced: DikinBaus Hot Dogs is sure to be a big hit here in town.
26;5;;Scene cuts to Cartman and Kenny watching TV in Kenny's house.
26;5;Cartman;[laughs] He said it! We got him to say DikinBaus!
26;5;Kenny;[laughs]
26;5;Reporter;The owners say they're planning on all kinds of rides and games. And also, with each hot dog served here at DikinBaus Hot Dogs, they actually use the ketchup to put a nice little smiley face on the plate.
26;5;Cartman;[laughs]
26;5;Kenny;[laughs]
26;5;Reporter;It's just their sort of trademark touch. The renovations are supposed to be finished soon and the new owners are inviting everyone to come on down, enjoy, and let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns.
26;5;Cartman;[laughs]
26;5;Kenny;[laughs]
26;5;Cartman;Let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns! [laughs]
26;5;;Butters enters Kenny's house.
26;5;Cartman;Oh. Hey, Butters. We have some of those first-quarter projections to show you. Do you have the first-quarter projections, Kenny?
26;5;Kenny;(Uh, let me see. Where did we put those?)
26;5;Butters;Are you guys just playing around?
26;5;Cartman;No, we are renovating and opening an amazing restaurant that will be extremely profitable.
26;5;Butters;Then why did you name it DikinBaus?
26;5;Cartman;Butters, you are the investor. We are the creatives.
26;5;Butters;Well, stop being creative and open the goddamn restaurant so I can get my money back! So stop dicking around and wasting my money.
26;5;Cartman;Butters, at DikinBaus, dicking around is all we do, dicking around the competition.

26;5;Liane;What on Earth?
26;5;;Liane goes outside.
26;5;Cartman;Okay, that's good! Mermaid goes to the mermaid grotto right over there.
26;5;Liane;Eric! Eric, I think you've done enough renovations.
26;5;Cartman;Mom, no offense, but will you shut your mouth because you know nothing about the restaurant business?
26;5;Construction worker;Excuse me, are you guys the owners?
26;5;Cartman;Yes, we're the owners.
26;5;Construction worker;Well, we got your zip line put in, but this asphalt is so old it's not going to hold the eye bolts.
26;5;Cartman;So, what does that mean?
26;5;Construction worker;I think you've got to re-asphalt the entire parking area or just lose the zip line.
26;5;Cartman;Well, obviously, we're not going to lose the zip line, so let's see what we can do.
26;5;Construction worker;Alright. Well then, over here on your mermaid grotto, the mermaid is in but she can't actually spit water because there's no plumbing underneath.
26;5;Cartman;Jesus Christ. Well, I guess we got to find a way to add plumbing.
26;5;Cartman;Alright, everyone, it's looking good, but we have aways to go. I don't know about you, but I am exhausted. I think we should all just take the rest of the day off because it's Wet's-Not-Work-Too-Hard Wednesday.
26;5;;Construction workers leave
26;5;;Butters arrives home from work.
26;5;Stephen;Back from work, Butters?
26;5;Butters;Oh. Hey, Mom and Dad.
26;5;Stephen;You must be so tired from selling all that ice cream.
26;5;Butters;Well, yeah. It was a pretty long night.
26;5;Stephen;A long night, he says. That's great, Butters. Only problem is, if you're really working at a job, then why is there $0 in your bank account?
26;5;Butters;What?
26;5;Stephen;So now what are you really doing, young man?
26;5;Butters;$0? But I've been working every day!
26;5;Stephen;Oh, sure. I know exactly how it is. You say you have to work so you can get out of the house, get away from the family, and you go down to that glory hole down on Fourth and Larimer.
26;5;Linda;Oh my God! Butters!
26;5;Stephen;And while your family thinks you're at your job, you're actually strapped face down on a bed at the Brighton Motel, taking any load you can find on Adultfriendfinder.
26;5;Linda;[cries]
26;5;Stephen;It's the lies! It's the lies! I can't take anymore. I'm going to go to the office and get some work done.

26;5;Cartman;Hey, Butters.
26;5;Butters;Gosh dang it, Eric! What the hell do you think you're doing? You can just take my money out of my gosh dang bank account without my permission...
26;5;Cartman;Butters. Butters! Would you relax?
26;5;Butters;Where's all the money gone from my bank account?
26;5;Cartman;You said to get things moving. We needed the funds to go faster.
26;5;Butters;You said you'd never access my account without my permission!
26;5;Cartman;Butters, we're about to reopen a historic landmark that means something to people. You think I'm just doing all this for the fun of it? Hang on a second.
26;5;;Cartman goes down the slide.
26;5;Cartman;We're creating jobs, Butters! And we're helping people.
26;5;Butters;Then open the stupid place, Eric!
26;5;Cartman;Fine! We'll start hiring tomorrow morning and we'll be open by the afternoon. And trust me, Butters, when we open and you see how successful it is, you're going to apologize to me.

26;5;Cartman;Yes! Please, have a seat.
26;5;;Darryl sits down.
26;5;Cartman;Um, so, what kind of experience do you have?
26;5;Darryl;Well, I was working down at the Budd factory in Fort Collins, but then Joe Biden caused a recession, so they took my job!
26;5;Kenny;(Whoa!)
26;5;Darryl;"Then I worked over at Waffle House, but they decided they needed employees to be more ""inclusive"", so they took my job!"
26;5;Kenny;(Sorry to hear that.)
26;5;Darryl;And then I got let go from the bowling alley, and all I want is a damn job!
26;5;Cartman;Well, I believe that we here at DikinBaus would like to hire you immediately.
26;5;Darryl;Okay. Can I work from home?
26;5;Kenny;(What?)
26;5;Cartman;No, you can't work from home. It's a hot dog stand!
26;5;Darryl;Well, I could work here, but I'll need mental health days off to deal with the toxic environment.
26;5;Cartman;Where do people get this stuff? Alright, fine. Never mind, we don't want to hire you.
26;5;Darryl;You're gonna take my job? They took my job!

26;5;Scott;We're happy to be here.
26;5;Cartman;Shut up, Scott. Now listen, it's going to take dedication and drive to get this place open. Isn't that right, Kenny?
26;5;;Cartman turns around laptop to reveal Kenny on video call.
26;5;Cartman;Sorry, Kenny's working from home today 'cause it's his mental health day.
26;5;Kenny;(Hey, guys.)
26;5;Toddler;Hi.
26;5;Cartman;Now, there may not be many of us. But in order to open, we're going to have to...
26;5;Clyde;Do I get mental health days, too?
26;5;Cartman;Oh, here we go. Fine, Clyde, what days do you need to have mental health days?
26;5;Clyde;Well, how should I know until I'm feeling mentally unhealthy?
26;5;Cartman;Goddammit, you guys! It isn't going to work like this, okay?
26;5;Scott;Um, I'm also going to need five-minute breaks every hour to check my insulin levels.
26;5;Cartman;You're fucking joking! This is a goddamn restaurant, you guys! There's no time for diabetes! You don't here Mrs. Anderson complaining about her time off!
26;5;Toddler;I don't work on No-Thinky Thursdays.
26;5;Cartman;Oh, that's it! That's it! I give up! It's impossible to open any kind of business these days when this generation doesn't know how to work!
26;5;;Butters arrives.
26;5;Butters;Hey, fellas.
26;5;Cartman;Oh, great! Now the bank is here. Scrooge McButters to collect on his money.
26;5;Butters;You haven't made any money.
26;5;Cartman;Butters, the truth is, we tried. The fact of the matter is, the U.S. government failed this generation by shutting down businesses in the pandemic, and now they don't know how to go back. I'm sorry, but we lost all your money. But there is a good side to this because, as you can see, I now have a house that has slides, and games, and a mermaid grotto. And you can come and hang out all you want.
26;5;Butters;[extremely furious] Gosh dang it!
26;5;;Butters goes to start cooking and serving hot dogs. Begin montage

26;5;Butters;There you are, ma'am! Thank you!
26;5;Female customer;Oh, look at the little smile on the plate, honey!
26;5;Male customer;Oh, you like that, don't you?
26;5;Cartman;You guys, it's working! We're doing it!

26;5;Customer 1;Hey, that's a pretty good hot dog!
26;5;Customer 2;I just love that they have all the fun stuff for kids to do here.
26;5;Customer;[to Cartman] Hey, great job kid!
26;5;Jimbo;You really did it, Eric!
26;5;Mayor McDaniels;Congratulations, Eric! You're a hero.
26;5;Cartman;Oh my God! Oh my God! This is a dream come true!
26;5;;End montage. Scene cuts to South Park Bank. Butters is meeting with a banker.
26;5;Banker;Well, congratulations, young man. DikinBaus Hot Dogs is a big success, and here's your first return on your investment. I'm sure there's many more to come.
26;5;Butters;Oh, I made my money back, huh?
26;5;Banker;Now what I'm thinking, Butters, is that we should grow your business by applying for a corporate loan, which could pay you dividends as you expand the company into new areas.
26;5;Butters;Yeah, I wasn't thinking that. See, all I ever wanted was just to do my job, learn how to work, and help Mr. Sullivan sell ice cream. So I'm thinking I'm actually going to conduct a market analysis to look for potential buyers and roll over the company as an exit strategy.
26;5;Banker;Well, you could do that, but I think you'd have trouble getting investors who will commit major capital for just partial ownership.
26;5;Butters;Yeah, so that's why I want to approach overseas investors who will buy the IP, the restaurant operations, and the real estate outright.
26;5;Banker;But you couldn't do that because there's already tenants in the building who have to be relocated.
26;5;Butters;Yeah, I thought of that too. Come on in.
26;5;;Liane enters.
26;5;Liane;Hello.
26;5;Banker;Wait, so you two have already discussed some kind of deal?
26;5;Liane;Oh, yes. Butters and I have been talking, and we think that my little Eric deserves to get exactly what he's been wanting for a long time.
26;5;;Scene cuts to DikinBaus. Liane drags Cartman out the front door.
26;5;Cartman;No! No, what are you doing? DikinBaus is mine! You can't sell DikinBaus!
26;5;;Scene cuts to the Cartmans' old house, which they are moving back in to.
26;5;Cartman;No! Take me back! No! Please!
26;5;Mover;This picture go over here, Mrs. Cartman?
26;5;Liane;Oh, yes. That's perfect. Thank you.
26;5;Cartman;What is this?
26;5;Liane;The new owners paid for us to have our old house back.
26;5;Cartman;I don't want my old house! I want DikinBaus!
