26;4;Nelly;What happened, Bebe?
26;4;Bebe;Clyde just sent me another text.
26;4;;The girls awe at Bebe, who is turning around and showing them her phone screen. Wendy frowns.
26;4;Nichole;Oh, what's this one say?
26;4;Bebe;I texted him if he thought about me all the time, and he texted back 'it certainly seems like all the time. It's hard to get someone like you out of my mind'.
26;4;Nichole, Betsy, Nelly and Red;Aww!
26;4;Bebe;Doesn't he just send the best texts ever?
26;4;;The girls agree with Bebe. The scene cuts to Wendy, who frowns over at Bebe and the girls, and then it cuts back to them.
26;4;Bebe;Yesterday I texted him 'how do you know you're in love with me?' And he said 'I know I'm in love with you because spending time with you makes me feel like I'm home, and I can't imagine life without you'.
26;4;Red;That's so sweet!
26;4;Wendy;Clyde wrote that?
26;4;;Bebe turns away, speaking into her phone. The other girls watch with smiles on their faces.
26;4;Bebe;O.M.G, Clyde, do you really care about me that much?
26;4;;The scene cuts to Red and Wendy.

26;4;;The scene cuts to Bebe's phone screen, displaying texts between her and Clyde.

26;4;Betsy;He sure is in love with you, Bebe!
26;4;Red;He's a goddamn dreamboat!
26;4;Bebe;Yeah, well, Clyde's just really into me. Oh, he's texting back.
26;4;;The girls walk away. Wendy stays. She takes out her phone and goes back over her and Stan's texts. Wendy scrolls down, seeing Stan respond with all of her texts with a thumbs-up emoji. She speaks into her phone.
26;4;Wendy;Hey, Stan... Is there a time we could talk today? I'm feeling a little insecure about some things...

26;4;;Clyde shuts his locker, and turns to Stan.
26;4;Clyde;Uh-huh.
26;4;Stan;Well, she says that she wishes I would reply to her texts the way that Clyde responds to Bebe so, like, how do you do it?
26;4;;Clyde looks around suspiciously, and moves his hand by his mouth to whisper to Stan.
26;4;Clyde;Chat GPT, dude.
26;4;Stan;Chat GPT?
26;4;;Clyde places his arm around Stan, they begin walking a few steps, before Clyde takes out his phone.
26;4;Clyde;Yeah, dude. There's a bunch of apps and programs you could subscribe to that use open AI to do all your writing for you. People use 'em to write poems, write job applications, but what they're really good for... is dealing with chicks. Here, check it out. There's tons of Chat GPT apps for your phone.
26;4;;The scene cuts to show Clyde's phone screen, displaying his messages with Bebe. He swipes to the home screen, clicks the Chat GPT app, and then returns to his and Bebe's texts.
26;4;Clyde;So, then I can take whatever latest dumb thing Bebe texted me, I copy it, then I open the GPT app, click 'respond to', paste her text here, hit 'write'. It just thinks for a second. 'You would look great with any length of hair! Trying a new look could be fun'. Copy that into messages and send it off. It's super easy and convenient and it saves me a ton of time because she texts me so goddamn much.
26;4;;Clyde's phone buzzes. The screen cuts back to the phone screen.
26;4;Clyde;Jesus Christ! 'I probably won't do it, but thanks for being supportive'. Cut. Paste. Write. Cut. Messages. Paste. Send. There.
26;4;;The screen cuts back to Clyde and Stan. Clyde wipes his hands together.
26;4;Clyde;All done with her stupid shit.
26;4;Stan;This is a real app?
26;4;Clyde;It'll completely change your life, bro. Just, uh, just don't tell anybody, huh? If Bebe found out, I'd be a dead man.
26;4;;Clyde walks away smiling. The screen cuts to Tegridy Farms, then to Stan in his room, at his desk. He takes out his phone, looking through his and Wendy's texts.

26;4;Wendy;Hey, Stan, I didn't get it yet.
26;4;Stan;Didn't get what?
26;4;Wendy;You asked me if I wanted a bedtime story about frogs, or a song about swans. I said a bedtime story!
26;4;Stan;Oh, yeah, I- I wrote it. I'll send it to you right now.
26;4;Wendy;Okay, bye!
26;4;;The scene cuts back to Stan. He opens the Chat GPT app, and types in 'write a nice bedtime story about frogs'. The app instantly responds. The scene cuts back to Wendy, lying in bed, reading the story. She hugs her phone close, and closes her eyes. The scene cuts back to South Park Elementary, then the classroom, where students are chatting and getting into their seats. Mr Garrison walks into frame after them.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Okay, children, let's take our seats. I've graded your midterm essays, and I have to say for the most part, they were terrible. However, there are some essays that I'm very happy with.
26;4;;Mr. Garrison begins handing out papers.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;There was a really great essay from Clyde on the '1840s Labor Unions and Their Effect on the Industrial Revolution'. Let's hear it for Clyde, kids! Great work, Clyde.
26;4;Clyde;Thank you. Thank you.
26;4;;The class applauses. Stan stares at Clyde, sitting at a desk by his side. He crosses his arms, looking suspiciously.
26;4;Stan;Uh-huh.
26;4;Clyde;What?
26;4;;The scene cuts back to Mr. Garrison.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Someone who never writes good essays, Butters, wrote an amazing piece on 'Post-Cold War Poland and the Changing Provision of Security'. Check plus, Butters!
26;4;Butters;Oh, uh... thanks.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Stan looking behind his desk, at Butters. He turns and stares suspiciously. Butters, forcing a smile, waves back. Stan turns.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;And we also have another student who wrote a shockingly good paper. This one's called 'A Feminist Neoliberal Perspective of Post-War Afghanistan'... by Eric Cartman!
26;4;Cartman;Ah, yes, thank you, thank you.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Stan staring at Cartman, beside him, suspiciously. Cartman side-eyes him.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;And this week, we have a new student to the check plus club, for an amazing essay called 'Writing a Policy About Improving the Rights of Migrant Workers'. Let's hear it for Stan!
26;4;;The class applauses, Stan forces a smile. At his side, Cartman stares suspiciously. Stan turns, and returns the look. The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom.
26;4;Cartman;Alright, what the hell is going on?
26;4;Stan;You tell me what's going on!
26;4;Cartman;Clearly, somebody told Stan about Chat GPT!
26;4;Stan;You guys are using it to write essays, too!
26;4;Cartman;Yes, we are all using it, and we had a pact that we wouldn't tell anyone else because then everyone will start using it, and Mr. Garrison will figure it out! So who the [bleep] blabbed to Stan?
26;4;Clyde;I just told Stan about it as a tool to text his girlfriend.
26;4;Cartman;[as he and Butters glare at Clyde] God damn it, Clyde! You don't use an amazing AI cheating tool to talk to girls! You're gonna ruin everything! This can't be open source, you guys! If everyone starts using Chat GPT, then we lose our unfair advantage.
26;4;;A student barges into the bathroom. He walks past the boys, and walks towards one of the urinals. The boys stay silent. The students starts peeing. He sniffs, grunts and farts. The boys continue to stay silent. Once the student is done, he flushes the urinal, and goes to the sink to wash his hands.
26;4;Cartman;Oh, god-[bleep]-damn it.
26;4;;The student grabs a paper towel, and turns to stare at the boys. He smashes the paper towel into a ball, wipes his hands, and throws it in the trash, still staring. After a second, he leaves.
26;4;Cartman;If they find out that we don't have to work anymore, then they aren't gonna want to work and then we're all screwed! Who's the one who first found Chat GPT and thought to use it for essays?
26;4;Clyde;Butters.
26;4;Cartman;Right. But then Butters told me about it, and I told him not to tell anyone else!
26;4;Butters;Right, but then you went and blabbed about it to Clyde.
26;4;Cartman;That's right. I was a little excited.
26;4;Stan;You guys, I'm not going to tell anyone else! You really think I want Wendy finding out about this thing?
26;4;Cartman;Fine. So we're all in it together. But you guys need to be careful what you use it for. Because once you bring girls into things, they're gonna ruin it. Just like slavery.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Mr. Garrison's residence, where he lives with his boyfriend, Rick. Garrison is at the table, grading papers. In the background, Rick is cutting up food.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Ugh... ugh, God, I can't take it, Rick!
26;4;Rick;What's the matter?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, it's just grading these stupid papers all the time! I have to read 'em all and comment on each one of them. Jesus Christ. Something's changed, and now a few of the kids are writing these really long, detailed essays. I don't know what's going on. I guess I've just taught them really well, maybe a bit too well.
26;4;Rick;Uh, yeah... Have you ever heard of Chat GPT?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Chat GP-whoza what? The [bleep] is that?
26;4;Rick;There's a few apps now, really. But see? It has AI and takes any subject matter and can instantly give you whatever kind of content you want.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Wait a minute... There's an app that anyone can use that does all the thinking and writing for you?
26;4;Rick;Yeah.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Well, this is gonna be amazing! I can use it to grade all my papers, and no one will ever know!
26;4;Rick;Uh, yeah, sure.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;I'll just type the title of the essay in, and it'll generate a comment, and I don't even have to read the stupid things!
26;4;Rick;Yeah, and then you'll have more free time.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, this is great. Thanks so much! Just gotta make sure nobody finds out I'm being sneaky. Oh, and- and, hey, Rick?
26;4;Rick;Yeah?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Thanks for all the replies to my texts today. They were really supportive.
26;4;Rick;Oh. Yeah. Sure thing.

26;4;Wendy;Well, I know it's not much, but I just wanted to take you out somewhere to say thanks, Stan.
26;4;Stan;For what?
26;4;Wendy;For stepping up and working on communication when I asked you to.
26;4;Stan;Oh, that's cool.
26;4;Wendy;The things we've talked about, Stan, it's really helping me. I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. I've been so scared for so long to tell anyone what happened to me when I was six.
26;4;Stan;Yeah.
26;4;Wendy;(Starts tearing up) And... everything you had to say about it was just right. It really changed the way I think about the whole thing.
26;4;Stan;Yeah.
26;4;Wendy;And when you said the same thing happened to you, I- I couldn't believe it. Were you at home when it happened?
26;4;Stan;Yep.
26;4;Wendy;But you're right. We can't dwell on those things. You're right about a lot of stuff. There was just that one thing I don't understand... about the boating accident in Switzerland?
26;4;Stan;The boating accident in Switzerland... was tough.
26;4;Wendy;I thought you said it was great.
26;4;Stan;It was great... and very tough.
26;4;Wendy;(Blinks back tears) But how did it cause the thing with your cousin?
26;4;Stan;Oh, shit. What time is it?
26;4;Wendy;It's a little after four.
26;4;Stan;Oh, shit. My mom told me to be home right at a little after four. Sorry, Wendy. I- I gotta get going.
26;4;Wendy;No, no, no, that's totally okay. I gotta get going, too.
26;4;Stan;Okay, cool.
26;4;;Wendy shuffles over, and hugs Stan. He is shocked.
26;4;Wendy;Thank you so much, Stan. Thank you for being the only real thing in my life.
26;4;;Wendy waves at Stan and leaves.

26;4;;The scene cuts to Bebe, who is holding her head and watching Clyde fondly, it cuts back to Clyde.
26;4;Clyde;'I can't help but smile when I hear it said... Bebe, the name always in my head'.
26;4;Cartman;Oh, God, so obvious.
26;4;Clyde;'I dream of spending my days with you, Bebe'.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Wendy and Stan. Stan is staring down at his desk, Wendy looks over with a smile. Stan looks back, forcing a smile. It cuts back to Clyde.
26;4;Clyde;'In South Park, or anywhere that maybay. Talking, laughing, just being together. In a dream I hope will last forever'.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Mr. Mackey walking in, he knocks on the door to alert Mr. Garrison and get his attention.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Excuse me, Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, yeah. What?
26;4;Mr. Mackey;I'm sorry, but I need to address your class really quick.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;M'kay, kids, I need to discuss a very serious matter. There is a rumor going around that someone at this school is using OpenAI technology to do their work.
26;4;;The scene cuts to Stan looking at Cartman, Cartman then looks at Stan, then Butters
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Well, that's crazy! Who would do that?
26;4;Mr. Mackey;"Now, I know that everyone at this school is honest, hard-working, m'kay, wouldn't...Wouldn't even want to use this ""ChatGBD""."
26;4;Butters;ChatGPT!
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Oh, m'kay. But the school board has decided to call in a company that can detect AI in schoolwork and make sure nobody here is cheating.
26;4;Cartman;They...They are gonna what?
26;4;Mr. Mackey;So we're just gonna collect all the school work that we can.
26;4;;Mr. Mackey collects all the assignments
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;And we're gonna have them analyzed for any AI contributions, m'kay?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Well, those are...Those aren't, uh, quite ready.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Don't worry, we'll get these all back to you after the testers look through them. M'kay, kids, sorry for the intrusion. Get back to your day, m'kay?
26;4;;The scene cuts to Cartman, Clyde, Butters and Stan walking into the boys' bathroom again.
26;4;Cartman;God fucking dammit! I told you guys this was gonna happen!
26;4;Butters;What are we gonna do?!
26;4;Cartman;There's nothing we can do. It's over, we've lost our unfair advantage.
26;4;Stan;That's not what's important. If they find out I've been using OpenAI for class, Wendy's gonna know I've been using it with her, and It's gonna crush her!
26;4;Clyde;Dude, same, Bebe's gonna fucking kill me!
26;4;Cartman;And who's fault is that, you guys? I told you that once you bring women into things, they ruin it just like they did slavery.
26;4;Butters;Okay, Eric, could you explain exactly how women ruined slavery?
26;4;Cartman;No, I can't! Because I can't use fucking ChatGPT anymore 'cause we got fucking busted!
26;4;Stan;Look, maybe...Maybe this AI-detection technology won't work.
26;4;Cartman;It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Cat is out of the bag now! This was supposed to be our thing, for us to get ahead, but now-
26;4;;A student barges into the bathroom again. He walks past the boys.
26;4;Cartman;God dammit, Get the fuck out of here!
26;4;;The student leaves the bathroom.
26;4;;Mr. Mackey's Office.
26;4;MR. Mackey;M'kay. I am just a little confused. You think we shouldn't have the kids' school work analyzed for using AI writing app?
26;4;;The scene cuts to Mr. Garrison
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Look, it’s just. It’s really unfair to the kids. I mean what are we saying that we don’t trust them? I mean geeze
26;4;;The scene goes back to Mr. Mackey
26;4;Mr. Mackey;But don’t you think if kids are not writing their own papers we should know?
26;4;;The scene goes back to Mr. Garrison
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Oh what are people afraid of? That AI is going to replace real writers, That Hollywood is going to become a bland recycling of old ideas it already is. AI might help it.

26;4;Mr. Mackey;Well I don’t know what you want me to

26;4;Stan;Mr. Garrison can I talk to you?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Uh is it important Stan I am kind of dealing with some stuff right now?
26;4;Stan;Yes it is important. You know when you done something wrong sometimes the best thing to do is to come out and admit it.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;uh. OK. OK you’re right. How did you find out?
26;4;Stan;Clyde told me about it. I came to you because if they find out something me and you punish me it’s going to really hurt Wendy.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;I don’t want to punish anyone Stan. I completely understand.
26;4;Stan;You do?
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Sure. I think most of the world does. I mean why does it matter who uses AI apps it’s just like having a good writers assistant.
26;4;Stan;Yeah. Like a good writers assistant.
26;4;Mr. Garrison;Yeah. I mean you are still taking the time to like push the buttons and stuff.
26;4;Stan;Yeah. So you really don’t think Wendy will be upset that I used ChatGPT to respond to her texts?

26;4;;Scene cuts to the hallway where fireworks sound are heard students are running and screaming.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Um OK everyone please just stay calm.

26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;We went throw thousands of papers but then Shadow Bain detected chat bot writing in this student phone (pulls out a phone). (Shadow Bain start attacking the phone) There you see she’s going crazy.
26;4;;Stan Oh no. [he runs to the library door and peeks in and sees Wendy.]
26;4;Wendy;What is going on?
26;4;Stan;Oh god oh no no the GPT stuff on her phone didn’t come from her.
26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;Keep all the children back Mackey. We can’t let it spread I will go inside and get her confession.
26;4;;School Advisory Board Technician enters the library and locks the door behind him and approaches Wendy and rings some bells around her as Shadow Bain comes.
26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;you have been cheating on your school work.
26;4;Wendy;No I haven’t.
26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;Silence. You have used ChatGPT to do your essays for you. Now have yourself the school.
26;4;Wendy;I write my own essays.
26;4;;Back out in the school hallway.
26;4;Stan;I don’t know what to do. I am not creative enough to think of a way out of this. Wait, that's it!
26;4;;outside the school Stan takes out his phone and starts typing On ChatGPT.
26;4;;Stan enters the school.
26;4;ChatGPT;Once upon a time, there was a boy named Stan who lived in South Park. Stan loved his girlfriend very much, but lately, he hadn't been truthful with her. One day, when Stan got to school, he was approached by his best friend.
26;4;Kyle;Dude, did you hear what happened to your girlfriend?
26;4;Stan;No what about her?
26;4;Kyle;Dude, she got caught cheating on her essay.
26;4;ChatGPT;Just then, Stan noticed a commotion down the hallway.
26;4;;Scene cuts to the hallway. Wendy (handcuffed) is being escorted by two police men while Mr. Mackey and the School Advisory Board Technician watch.
26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;This student is going to jail for cheating.

26;4;Stan;Hold it right there!
26;4;Stan;Look, everyone. We can't blame people who are using ChatGPT. It's not their fault.
26;4;;Scene cuts to Mr. Mackey.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Well whose fault is it?
26;4;;Scene cuts to Stan.
26;4;Stan;I tell you who. It's the giant tech companies who took OpenAI, packaged it, monetized it, and pushed it out to all of us as fast as they could in order to get ahead. OpenAI is so powerful that it has to be something that everyone can use, control and contribute to, or else AI will be controlled by corporations who just want an unfair advantage like Cartman does.
26;4;;Scene cuts to Eric Cartman.
26;4;Cartman;Hey! Screw you, you dumb Jew!
26;4;;Scene cuts to Stan.
26;4;Stan;We don't want big corporations deciding what is ethical and acceptable for AI. We were all taken advantage of and that's why my girlfriend will totally understand that I used ChatGPT to respond to her text.
26;4;Wendy;That's right!
26;4;;Scene cuts to Wendy.
26;4;;A police officer takes Wendy's handcuffs off.
26;4;Police officer;Well I guess we can let you go now ma'am.
26;4;;Scene cuts to School Advisory Board Technician.
26;4;School Advisory Board Technician;I will find these tech companies who are trying to use OpenAI for their own gains and I will stop them.
26;4;Mr. Mackey;Mm-kay, kids, I think we can all go home, mm-kay?
26;4;ChatGPT;Everyone was happy, and Stan's girlfriend completely forgave him.
26;4;Wendy;Thanks for saving me, Stan!
26;4;Stan;You're welcome, sweetheart!

26;4;Students;Yay!
26;4;;Scene cuts.
26;4;Stan;Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
26;4;Wendy;Yeah, but, I'm still really not sure what just happened.
26;4;Stan;Well, at least now we know that sometimes a good old thumbs-up from a human is better than a machine-generated lie.
26;4;Wendy;Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Stan. I love you.
26;4;Clyde;Dude, how did you pull all that off?
26;4;Stan;ChatGPT, dude.
