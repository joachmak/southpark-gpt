26;6;Garrison;Hey, Rick!
26;6;Rick;Oh. Hey, Herb.
26;6;Garrison;So, you know what this week is, right?
26;6;Rick;Um, is it Easter?
26;6;Garrison;No, it's my spring break! No school for seven days! And guess what? Go pack your things because you and I are going on a big, romantic trip!
26;6;Rick;Really?
26;6;Garrison;I just came from the travel agent. We're gonna spend five nights in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
26;6;Rick;Oh.
26;6;Garrison;Well, what's the matter?
26;6;Rick;Myrtle Beach? Really? We all know what goes on down there. I don't do that stuff anymore, and neither should you.
26;6;Garrison;Rick, I don't wanna go down there to rage. I just wanna sit on the beach with you and watch the sunset.
26;6;Rick;Yeah, but isn't Myrtle Beach where those places are?
26;6;Garrison;I don't wanna go into one of those places. I don't think they even exist anymore. Don't you think this is just what we need, Rick?
26;6;Rick;You don't even wanna go into one of those places?
26;6;Garrison;Rick, I'm a little old for that. It'd be pretty pathetic if I did.
26;6;Rick;Well, okay!
26;6;Garrison;Oh, Rick! We're gonna have the best time! I can't wait to spoil you.
26;6;Rick;I really do need a vacation.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, we're gonna have the best spring break of anyone!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. Sharon and Shelley are leaving for the week.
26;6;Randy;Alright, guys, you sure you packed everything?
26;6;Sharon;Yeah, that should be all of it.
26;6;Randy;Well, I hope you and Shelley have a great spring break trip.
26;6;Sharon;I still feel bad, us going on a trip while you and Stan stay home.
26;6;Randy;You guys have fun in Santa Fe. We're going to do some dad-and-son stuff. Goodbye, Shelley! Have fun! I'll miss you!
26;6;Sharon;There should be food enough to last you the week.
26;6;Randy;Yes, yes, don't worry. We'll be fine.
26;6;Sharon;Bye, Stan! Love you!
26;6;Stan;Love you, Mom!
26;6;Randy;Okay, guys, be safe!
26;6;Sharon;Bye!
26;6;;Sharon and Shelley leave.
26;6;Randy;Aww, jeah! Bitches are gone!
26;6;;Randy strips down to his underwear. Stan starts painting board-game miniatures on the coffee table.
26;6;Randy;Spring break! Spring break! Spring break! This is gonna be the best spring break ever! They're gonna be gone the whole week!
26;6;;Randy opens a can of beer.
26;6;Randy;Bro, what are you doing?
26;6;Stan;I'm painting miniatures.
26;6;Randy;Painting min... Dude, do you not understand? Your mom and Shelley are gone! We can do whatever we want without any stupid rules!
26;6;Stan;Whatever I want?
26;6;Randy;Yeah, dude! That's what this is all about! Let's do some spring break shit!
26;6;Stan;"Can I see if any of the guys wanna come over to do ""40k"" all week?"
26;6;Randy;"Hell, yeah, let's do some ""40k"". What is that?"
26;6;Stan;"You don't know ""Warhammer 40k""?"
26;6;Randy;"Oh, yeah, ""Warhammer 40k"", of course. I'm down. Let's do it."
26;6;Stan;Really? All week?
26;6;Randy;Yeah, dude! You're old enough.
26;6;Stan;Sweet, I'm gonna call Tolkien!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Myrtle Beach.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, Rick. Isn't this nice? This place is incredible.
26;6;Rick;Yeah, it's really nice. I just don't know if I deserve all this.
26;6;Garrison;You do deserve it, Rick. You've made me really happy. Are you almost done?
26;6;Painter;Yeah, all done. Here you go.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, Rick. Look at how happy we are.
26;6;;Camera cuts to the street.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, that saltwater air is just so good. Can't wait to try some Southern food. You hungry?
26;6;Rick;Yeah, sure. I could eat.
26;6;Garrison;A lot of things are different here in the South. Kinda hard to figure out what's good.
26;6;Rick;Yeah, all the stores and restaurants here aren't like Colorado. It's almost like another culture... Herb? Herb?
26;6;;Garrison notices a MAGA store.
26;6;Rick;Oh, no.
26;6;Garrison;Geez. It's still here.
26;6;Rick;You said you wouldn't go into one of these places.
26;6;Garrison;I don't wanna go in. I just can't believe some of these places are still here.
26;6;Store owner;Whoa! Look who's here! What are you doing in town?
26;6;Garrison;Oh, I'm just on vacation. This is Rick.
26;6;Store owner;Well, do you wanna come inside and rally a little bit?
26;6;Garrison;Oh, no thanks. I don't rally anymore.
26;6;Store owner;You sure? Everyone would love to rally with you again!
26;6;Garrison;I'm sure. I don't need to rally. I'm just here to relax. Take care.
26;6;Store owner;Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here! America number one!
26;6;Garrison;Number one, yep.
26;6;Garrison;[to Rick] Some people, huh? Geez.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. Stan, Tolkien, and Randy are playing Warhammer 40k.
26;6;Stan;Okay, so I'm gonna have my Retributor Squad attack your Stormhawk Interceptor.
26;6;Tolkien;Okay, that has a toughness of 7 and a -1 to your hit rolls.
26;6;Stan;Okay, so that's three, four, five hits.
26;6;Tolkien;Okay, I'm gonna roll my saving throw, which is 3+.
26;6;Randy;What in the actual fuck are you guys doing?
26;6;Stan;"We're playing ""40k""."
26;6;Randy;You guys have wasted another day of spring break with this stupid shit! Do you guys know what spring break is about? Wet t-shirt contests! Mud wrestling! Don't you wanna get some bitches over here?
26;6;Stan;I thought you were happy 'cause the bitches were gone.
26;6;Randy;I'm happy the bitches are gone so we can have bitches over! Spring break is dude time! But you know what? Today's society has ruined it all. They've taught you boys to be ashamed of being boys. Convinced you that your natural innate male desires are toxic. No matter what the liberals try to tell you, boys, you shouldn't be ashamed of your gender.
26;6;Stan;Okay, Dad. So I've got an Imperium infantry unit within six inches of Celestine, so they have a +6 save.
26;6;Randy;My God. What are we going to do?
26;6;;Scene cuts to Myrtle Beach at night. Rick is asleep, while Mr. Garrison is awake in bed.
26;6;Garrison;I'm going to sleep. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Here I go... to sleep.
26;6;Garrison;Rick?
26;6;;Garrison gets up and gets dressed, and then goes to the MAGA store.
26;6;Store owner;Can I help you find anythingâ€“ Oh my God! Sir, you're back!
26;6;Garrison;Yeah, just browsing.
26;6;Store owner;You guys, it's him! He's here!
26;6;;A crowd of customers assembles around Garrison
26;6;Customer 1;Is that really you?
26;6;Customer 2;What are you doing here?
26;6;Customer 3;Can I get a selfie with you?
26;6;Store owner;Hey, uh, since you're here, you wanna rally a little bit?
26;6;Garrison;No, no. I can't rally. I've got a serious boyfriend. I'm just looking around.
26;6;Store owner;Oh, come on! When are you gonna be here again? Live a little!
26;6;Garrison;Well, maybe I could do just a little bit. I mean... What the hell is up with all these Mexicans? Huh?
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;Yeah! I mean, Joe Biden obviously thinks immigrants are made of gold or something! Piece of shit!
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Credigree Weed. Randy knocks on the door, and Steve answers.
26;6;Randy;Hey, Steven. You know your son's been over at my house for spring break?
26;6;Steve;Yeah, of course I know.
26;6;Randy;Well, you should see what they're doing, 'cause it's a little...
26;6;Steve;Well, what are they doing?
26;6;Randy;Look, I just think we better talk with our boys to counteract all the ways in which society has been pathologizing masculinity. I mean, you went balls-out on spring break, right? Tried to see chicks' boobs and stuff?
26;6;Steve;Um, no I didn't.
26;6;Randy;Well, no, I mean, you weren't ashamed of being a guy, right? Like, you went out to the lake and tried to play grab-ass with girls, right?
26;6;Steve;No, I did not.
26;6;Randy;Why are you saying that? Why are you making those words with your mouth?
26;6;Linda;Oh, hey, Randy. Everything okay with the boys?
26;6;Randy;Oh, right. Sorry, yeah, everything's great. They're playing a little table miniatures game. It's great. Just, uh, came to let you know they're good.
26;6;Randy;[to Steve] Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of it.
26;6;;Scene cuts to MAGA store.
26;6;Garrison;I'll tell you what else. This whole situation in the Ukraine? That wouldn't be happening on my watch!
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;The problem is now we all have a president who's afraid. And that's why Joe and the ho have got to go!
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;And I'll tell you another thing! It's that...
26;6;;Garrison's phone rings.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, hang on a second.
26;6;;Garrison looks at his phone and sees that Rick is calling.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, crap. Hold, on a second, everybody.
26;6;;Garrison answers phone.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, hey, Rick!
26;6;Rick;Where are you?
26;6;Garrison;I couldn't sleep, Rick. I was just tossing and turning, and I didn't want to wake you up, so I decided to come out and buy some sunscreen and stuff for our beach day tomorrow.
26;6;Rick;Oh, okay. I got scared that you were out rallying.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, jeez, well, that's silly. Last thing I wanna do is rally. Listen up: get back to sleep, Rick. I'll be right home, okay?
26;6;Rick;Okay, sorry for panicking. Bye.
26;6;Garrison;Bye-bye.
26;6;Garrison;Okay, uh, nice to meet you, everybody. I need to get going.
26;6;Store owner;Oh, come on! Just rally with us a little bit more.
26;6;Garrison;No, I really can't.
26;6;Store owner;Just a few more minutes! Come on!
26;6;Garrison;Alright, I guess I can rally just a little bit longer. I mean, after all, I am here for you. I am your warrior! Liberal left! Hunter Biden laptop!
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;Yeah! Yeah!
26;6;;Scene cuts to following morning. Garrison is asleep. Rick then pulls the curtains, and Garrison wakes up.
26;6;Garrison;Ugh. Oh, jeez.
26;6;Rick;Herb? Herb, you gotta get up. We're gonna miss our whole beach day.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, it's just the time change, Rick. You enjoy the beach. I just gotta sleep a little longer.
26;6;Rick;Okay.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Rick on the beach by himself.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. Stan and Tolkien are playing Warhammer 40k.
26;6;Stan;"Dude, it's so awesome being able to leave ""Warhammer"" set up all night and come back to it in the morning!"
26;6;Tolkien;I know, it's great!
26;6;Randy;Hey, hey, you guys. What did you do?
26;6;Stan;What do you mean?
26;6;Randy;I mean the cops are here. What did you guys do?
26;6;Tolkien;"We're just continuing our game of ""40k"" from last night."
26;6;Randy;Okay, you guys, just stop 'cause the police want to ask you some questions. Come on in, officers.
26;6;;A pair of strippers dressed as police officers enter.
26;6;Stripper 1;Hello, gentlemen! Hands up!
26;6;Stripper 2;We heard somebody in here's been bad!
26;6;Randy;Oh no, guys! Looks like you're in big trouble. You better read 'em their rights.
26;6;Stan;Hey, whoa, whoa! Don't touch the models! We spent a long time on this!
26;6;Randy;Stan, stop with that shit! Come on, get into it! Wet t-shirt contest!
26;6;;Randy throws water on Stripper 1.
26;6;Stripper 1;Hey, what the fuck!
26;6;Randy;What?
26;6;;Alonzo Fineski enters.
26;6;Fineski;Hey, you fuck guy! You do not harass the ladies!
26;6;Randy;Well, I wanted strippers, not prudes!
26;6;;Fineski draws a handgun.
26;6;Fineski;You wanna talk, big man? Huh? You wanna be big man?
26;6;Randy;Whoa, whoa, okay. I think I need to explain something to you, okay? Look, I'm just trying to combat the messages that the liberal left is putting out to young men about their male instincts being toxic.
26;6;Fineski;The fuck you talking?
26;6;Randy;You know, I'm trying to show my son and his nerdy little friend what a real party is, 'cause society wants them to be ashamed of their masculine natures.
26;6;Fineski;You want real party?
26;6;Randy;Yeah! Truth is, I got a whole barn full of weed.
26;6;Fineski;I will call some friends.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Myrtle Beach. Rick is on the street searching for Garrison.
26;6;;Rick calls Garrison.
26;6;Phone;The person you are trying to reach cannot be located. Please leave a message. [beep]
26;6;Rick;Where are you? I got back from the beach and you were gone. Please pick up!
26;6;;"Rick sees a sign that says ""MAGA CONVENTION TONIGHT! TOP FLOOR. Let's go 2024!"
26;6;;Scene cuts to convention. Rick enters, and then finds Garrison.
26;6;Garrison;And we're gonna take Georgia, and we're gonna take Arizona this time!
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;And when I say we're gonna take Arizona in the election, I mean we're gonna take it again, 'cause we all know I won it last time, too!
26;6;;Garrison notices Rick.
26;6;Garrison;Oh. Hey, everybody. This is Rick.
26;6;;Rick leaves. Garrison follows.
26;6;Garrison;Rick! Rick, will you just wait!
26;6;Rick;You know it's two in the morning? I was alone at the hotel while you were out rallying!
26;6;Garrison;I just wanted to rally for a little bit.
26;6;Rick;Yeah, you really look like you just rallied a little bit.
26;6;Garrison;I got a text that Tucker was in town, and I just wanted to go rally for a little bit.
26;6;Rick;You really think those people care about you, Herb? They don't. They just wanna do that.
26;6;Garrison;Rick, I got it out of my system now. We can still have a great vacation. Let's just start over tomorrow. Okay?
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. A huge party is going on, while Stan and Tolkien continue to play Warhammer 40k.
26;6;Randy;Alright, alright, let's do this! Okay, you ready? Three, two, one, go!
26;6;;Randy swings on the chandelier over the table.
26;6;Randy;Check it out, guys!
26;6;;The chandelier comes loose and falls to the floor. An ambulance then appears.
26;6;EMT;Sir, do you think you can walk?
26;6;Randy;No, I don't think so.
26;6;EMT;Sir, we think you've had too much to drink, and we should probably take you to the hospital.
26;6;Randy;No, I can't. I have to stay here, 'cause I'm in charge of my son. Today's woke culture has vilified his manhood and made him ashamed of himself.
26;6;EMT;Okay, sir, but it appears you have a broken arm and several fractured ribs.
26;6;Randy;Yeah, but I can't leave because my son's natural instincts are being suppressed and it's leading to behavioral problems. You see the shit he's doing? He's over there playing with dolls!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Myrtle Beach. Garrison and Rick are at a restaurant. Garrison is struggling.
26;6;Garrison;It's pretty good fondue, right?
26;6;Rick;We should probably just go back to the hotel. You've got the shakes from rallying all night.
26;6;Garrison;No, no, Rick. This is our vacation. I want us to have a nice romantic lunch.
26;6;Rick;Maybe we should just go back to Colorado.
26;6;Garrison;No, Rick. I'm gonna make this up to you. I don't want to rally anymore. There's just a lot of people out there who won't let it go, you know?
26;6;Rick;Yes, and you can't be around them!
26;6;Garrison;I know. I know. Let me just go throw up because I'll feel much better.
26;6;Rick;Okay, go throw up, Herb.
26;6;;Garrison goes to the bathroom and tries to throw up, but can't.
26;6;Garrison;Come on, just stop! Stop! The country is fine! You have better things to do!
26;6;;A man walks into the bathroom. He has a MAGA 2024 tattoo on his foot.
26;6;;Rick walks into the bathroom, to find Garrison rallying with the man.
26;6;Garrison;Yeah! Aw yeah! That's it! Yeah! We're gonna get abortion rights thrown the hell out so those dirty lesbians can't keep having abortions!
26;6;Man;Yeah! Oh, yeah, man!
26;6;Garrison;We're gonna get those Black Lives Matter protestors off the streets with a fire hose!
26;6;Man;Yeah, America! Yeah!
26;6;Garrison;Yeah!
26;6;;Garrison notices Rick.
26;6;Garrison;Rick!
26;6;Rick;Fuck you!
26;6;;Rick leaves.
26;6;Garrison;Well, to hell with you! Nobody controls me!
26;6;;Garrison and the man continue rallying.
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. A pair of police officers shows up, and the female officer knocks on the door. A man opens the door.
26;6;Man;Can I help you?
26;6;Female police officer;We've had some complaints about a party that's been going on for three days here.
26;6;Randy;Hey, what's going on?
26;6;;Randy notices the officer.
26;6;Randy;Alright guys, who ordered the stripper?
26;6;Female police officer;Can we come in and look around, sir?
26;6;Randy;Oh yeah! Come on in!
26;6;;Randy tries to grope the officer.
26;6;Randy;Honk honk!
26;6;Female police officer;Alright, get down on the ground!
26;6;Randy;Whoa, whoa! No, no, no. It's okay. I'm just helping my boy through the media assault on manliness.
26;6;;The officer tazes randy and handcuffs him.
26;6;Female police officer;I need to see some ID, sir.
26;6;Randy;Ah! Okay, okay! Stan! Stan!
26;6;Stan;Yeah?
26;6;Randy;Can you get my wallet from the upstairs?
26;6;Stan;Yeah, as soon as we're done with this psyker phase. I have five psyker units.
26;6;Randy;Oh my God. This is so embarrassing!
26;6;;The male police officer enters.
26;6;Male police officer;Hey! Freeze! You, right there!
26;6;;The officer draws his gun on Fineski.
26;6;Male police officer;That's Alonzo Fineski, the Romanian sex trafficker!
26;6;Fineski;Fuck you, big man!
26;6;;Fineski draws his gun and engages with the officer. Everyone else at the party flees in terror. The female officer is shot, and falls on top of Randy. The male officer than chases Fineski through the house.
26;6;Randy;Stan! Stan!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Myrtle Beach International Airport. Rick is waiting by himself.
26;6;;Garrison's rally starts playing on TV.
26;6;Announcer;And now, ladies and gentlemen, here he is, the once and future President of the United States of America!
26;6;Garrison;Thank you. I am here today for those who have been wronged.
26;6;;Crowd cheers.
26;6;Garrison;For those who have been betrayed. And let me tell you that nobody in this country has been betrayed more than my Ricky Rick.
26;6;;Crowd stops cheering.
26;6;Garrison;Rick, I am so sorry. And if you are out there, I want you to know that I love you. You are the only thing that keeps me from doing all this stupid stuff. When I met you, I felt in control of myself for the first time. There has never been anyone who calmed me down more than my little Ricky Bear. You are my boo.
26;6;;Rally attendee
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. Randy is by himself watching the rally.
26;6;Garrison;The truth is, some of us simply can't be alone. We need a relationship so that we're accountable to someone. I realize now how broken I am without that person who keeps me from destroying myself.
26;6;Randy;Sh-Sharon?
26;6;Garrison;And all I've ever done was take you for granted and wished I wasn't being controlled.
26;6;;Randy calls Sharon.
26;6;Randy;[sobbing] Hi, Sharon. Will you please come home?
26;6;;Scene cuts to Rick.
26;6;Garrison;Rick, I am a giant piece of shit without you. I don't deserve another chance. You have been wronged. You have been betrayed. And the only person who deserves retribution is me. I know you all really want to rally and rage, but the only thing I have to say is that I love Rick. I love Rick! I love Rick!
26;6;Crowd;[repeated] I love Rick!
26;6;Garrison;I love you, Rick!
26;6;;"Scene cuts to a mob storming the Capitol, chanting ""I love Rick!""."
26;6;Capitol Police officer;Oh, crap. Here we go again!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Tegridy Farms. Sharon and Shelley arrive.
26;6;Sharon;It's okay, Randy. We're back.
26;6;Randy;I'm sorry I cut your trip short.
26;6;Sharon;It's okay, Randy. You made it longer than last spring break.
26;6;Stan;Oh. Hey, Mom.
26;6;Sharon;"Stanley, what have I told you about playing ""Warhammer"" on the kitchen table?"
26;6;Stan;Aw!
26;6;;Scene cuts to Garrison & Rick's house. Rick is waiting outside. Garrison arrives in a taxi.
26;6;;Rick opens his arms.
26;6;Garrison;Oh, Rick!
26;6;;Garrison and Rick hug.
26;6;Garrison;I don't want to go through all that again. I just want to stay in South Park with you.
26;6;Rick;Well, I guess we'll just have to see what happens.
26;6;;Garrison and Rick go inside.
