26;2;;"A church in Canada. A rendition of Mozart's ""The Requiem"" plays as a funeral is taking place. Several people are standing, paying their respects to The Queen, as her casket is being carried."
26;2;Announcer;Today is a tragic day for Canada. Thousands of Canadians have gathered to mourn the passing of their beloved mother. The Queen is dead.
26;2;;The scene cuts to a computer screen streaming the funeral service. Ike is watching it happen, crying through it all.
26;2;Announcer;Every Canadian everywhere is feeling absolute emptiness right now. And now the casket is brought down the aisle with the Queen inside. The Queen's body being carried by the royal guard. What a horrible day for Canada and therefore the world.
26;2;;Ike continues to sob, and Kyle walks into the room.
26;2;Kyle;Ike -- Ike, come on, dude, you can't keep doing this.
26;2;Ike;She's dead. She's dead, Kyle.
26;2;Kyle;Ike, the Queen died like four months ago. You gotta let it go.
26;2;;The scene cuts back to footage of the funeral, as the royal guards place The Queen's casket down.
26;2;Announcer;And here comes Canada's most beloved musician, Sir Smelly John. [Sir Smelly John makes his way to the piano] Yes, Smelly John is sitting down at the piano with a tribute for the Queen, I believe.
26;2;Sir Smelly John;"Goodbye, queefy Queen
Seems as though you've queefed your last queef..."
26;2;;All of those in attendance begin to cry in unison, including Ike as he continues to watch the funeral.
26;2;Kyle;Okay, it's 7:00, it's my turn to use the computer.
26;2;Ike;No!
26;2;Kyle;"Ike, me and my friends are playing ""Darktide"" right now. Get off!"
26;2;;Kyle and Ike begin to fight for the computer.
26;2;Ike;Fuck you, Kyle! [starts crying]
26;2;;Cutting back to the funeral.
26;2;Announcer;Oh, and now people are starting to stare angrily. Y-Yes, it looks like the Prince and his new wife have just shown up. [The Prince and Princess of Canada walk down the aisle to find a seat] The Prince and his wife have, of course, been bashing the Canadian monarchy. A lot of Canadians hate them now. [The Earl of Halifax walks up to the Prince and his wife and farts on them] Oh, and I believe the Earl of Halifax has just farted on the Prince's wife's face! The Prince seems to have taken offense to this. Oh, this is bad now.
26;2;;Back in the bedroom. Kyle and Ike continue to fight.
26;2;Kyle;"Ike, I'm playing ""Darktide"" with my friends!"
26;2;Ike;No, get off me!
26;2;Kyle;Ike, goddamn it, get off!!
26;2;;South Park Elementary. Kyle walks up to Stan, Cartman and Kenny, looking down at the floor in disappointment.
26;2;Kyle;Hey, guys.
26;2;Stan;Kyle, dude, where were you last night?
26;2;Cartman;Yeah, we were all waiting.
26;2;Kyle;Look, I know you think I haven't been showing up for things, but -- but I got screwed by my little brother. He just keeps crying about the Queen. And then there's this Prince and his wife and they're bashing the Canadian monarchy. [The rest of the boys exchange glances at each other as Kyle continues talking] I guess it's like people don't even know why they showed up to the funeral. But anyway, I'm really sorry I ruined game time for everyone.
26;2;Cartman;You didn't ruin it for anyone. We played without you.
26;2;Kyle;What? Y-You guys, we -- we said we'd all level up together.
26;2;Stan;Well, yeah, we're all like level 12 now.
26;2;Cartman;We got some sweet drip, dude.
26;2;Kenny;(Sweet drip, dude!)
26;2;Kyle;But this isn't fair, it wasn't my fault.
26;2;Tolkien;Hey guys. Did you get to upgrade your gun, Stan?
26;2;Stan;Yeah, it's got a lot better range now. What about you? [The school bell rings]
26;2;Tolkien;I kept the same gun, but I got some sweet drip. [The boys begin to leave]
26;2;Cartman;Nice, sweet drip, dude!
26;2;Kenny;(Haha, yeah, sweet drip, dude.)
26;2;;Kyle is left behind, until Butters walks up to him, placing a hand on Kyle's shoulder.
26;2;Butters;It stinks, doesn't it?
26;2;Kyle;What stinks?
26;2;Butters;When people make certain judgements about you. I've been watching you, Kyle, and I can see your having some problems with your brand.
26;2;Kyle;[confused] My brand?
26;2;;The school's playground. Butters and Kyle are sitting by the stairs as they are having a conversation.
26;2;Butters;You see, everyone has an image, Kyle. Some kids call it your credibility, or your reputation, but those things are just little parts of something much more important -- your brand. Think about it, Kyle. Who are you?
26;2;Kyle;I'm just -- I-I'm just me.
26;2;Butters;See? You don't know what your brand is. So how is anyone else supposed to know? It's like a commercial for Kyle, but you're not putting a label on the jar.
26;2;Kyle;Butters, this seems very out of character for you.
26;2;Butters;That's because I've been workin' on my brand. My parents saw that my brand wasn't working with people, so they sent me to brand management.
26;2;Kyle;Brand management?
26;2;;CumHammer Brand Management. Butters and Kyle walk inside the building, taking a look around at what it is about exactly. Butters walks up to Mr. Davis, waving at him.
26;2;Butters;Hi, Mr. Davis!
26;2;Mr. Davis;Well, Butters Stotch. How you doing there, Butters? How's the brand going?
26;2;Butters;Great! I made two friends, and a girl asked me to help her with her homework.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Well, there ya go there, Butters.
26;2;Butters;My friend Kyle here was thinking of reworking his brand a bit, and I told him maybe you could help.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Oh, well, sure there, Kyle, let's just get you to fill out a CumHammer survey, and then we'll go in the back and come up with some options for ya.
26;2;;Good Morning Canada studio. The crowd applauds as the show begins.
26;2;Announcer;"Live, from the television studios in Toronto, it's ""Good Morning, Canada!"" [fart noise]"
26;2;Host;It has been several months since our beloved Queen has died. All Canadians are finding it hard to go on. All Canadians, that is, except for our first guests, The Prince and his wife.
26;2;;"The Prince and Princess of Canada walk up to the stage, the both of them holding up signs that say ""Stop looking at us!"" and ""We want our privacy!!"" The audience boos."
26;2;Prince and Princess;We want privacy! We want privacy!
26;2;Prince;Thanks for having us in the show. [They both sit down]
26;2;Princess;It's so awesome to be here. It's great.
26;2;Host;"So let me start with you, sir. You lived a life with the royal family, you had everything handed to you, but you say your life has been hard, and you've written all aboot it in your new book, ""Waaagh."""
26;2;Prince;Yes that's right, fwiend. You see, my wife and I are --
26;2;Princess;"I was totally like, ""You should write a book 'cause your family's, like, stupid, and then so are, like, journalists."""
26;2;Host;So you hate journalists?
26;2;Prince;That's right!
26;2;Host;And now you wrote a book that reports on the lives of the royal family.
26;2;Prince;Right.
26;2;Host;So you're a journalist.
26;2;Princess;We just want to be normal people. All this attention is so hard.
26;2;Host;Isn't it true, sir, that your questionable wife has her own TV show and hangs out with celebrities and does fashion magazines?
26;2;Prince;What are you suggesting?
26;2;Host;Well, I just think some people might say that your Instagram-loving bitch wife actually doesn't want her privacy?
26;2;Prince;How dare you, sir! My Instagram-loving bitch wife has always wanted her privacy! And you know what else? To hell with Canada! We are leaving! We'll go find some quiet place where we can be normal people! Come on, wife.
26;2;;The Prince and Princess leave the studio, as they pick up their signs and begin to protest.
26;2;Prince and Princess;We want privacy! We want privacy!
26;2;;An upbeat song begins to play, as a montage shows the Prince and Princess of Canada travelling across the globe to find their quiet place.
26;2;;"Come, on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on,"
26;2;;The Prince and Princess roam around France, still holding their sings and protesting.
26;2;Prince and Princess;We want privacy!
26;2;;"It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause we want some privacy"
26;2;;They are now in India, as they run around, still protesting.
26;2;Prince and Princess;We want privacy! We want privacy!
26;2;;"It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
Because we need some privacy
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour"
26;2;;Now, at Sydney, Australia. The Prince and Princess continue to protest for their privacy, but this time to the kangoroos.
26;2;Prince and Princess;We want privacy! We want privacy!
26;2;;The montage continues on, and now the Prince and Princess are in New York at a basketball stadium, as they keep protesting non-stop.
26;2;;"The Worldwide Privacy Tour is coming soon to your town
We're coming soon to your town, give us privacy
Come on, come on, come on
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour"
26;2;;The Prince and Princess look at a map of the US, and the Prince points to the state of Colorado, presumably as their next location to protest. They arrive at Aspen and continue with their song and dance.
26;2;;"Come on, come on, come on,
Come on, Come on
It's the Worldwide Privacy Tour
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause we want some privacy"
26;2;;The montage draws to a close, as the Prince and Princess make their way to South Park, still protesting and holding their signs.
26;2;;CumHammer Brand Management. Butters and Kyle are sitting down with Mr. Davis at his desk as he types on his computer.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Alright there, Kyle, we got your survey answers, and I think we've put together some great ideas for your brand. I want understand you want people to like you more and think you're cool. Is that right?
26;2;Kyle;Yeah.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Alright, well, let's see how this brand works for you. We got... Kyle -- Rugged. Vegan. Compassionate. Victim.
26;2;Kyle;I-I don't think that's really me.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Well, that's fine 'cause there's a lot of different brands people are attracted to. How about this one? [mouse click] Kyle -- Senstitive. Outdoorsy. Frugal. Victim.
26;2;Kyle;I'm not -- I'm not that outdoorsy.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Okay, well, remember there, Kyle, it's not so much about who you are as much as it is about what people are attracted to, okay? So, let's see, how about this? [mouse click] Kyle -- Wealthy. Handsome. Multi-talented Grammy Award-Winning. Victim. Oh, that -- that one's taken already. Sorry. Hold on. [more mouse clicks] Just a minute, Kyle. We're gonna find a good one here for you.
26;2;Butters;You'll see, Kyle. When you have your brand up and runnin', no one can stop you.
26;2;;The Prince and Princess of Canada walk over the hill, looking over the town of South Park in the distance.
26;2;Princess;Look at this town. There's just something about it. Oh, darling. I think this might be the place.
26;2;Prince;You really think so?
26;2;Princess;It's so quiet and empty here. If we moved here, then people would think we're really serious about wanting to be normal.
26;2;Prince;It does seem perfect, doesn't it? We can have a fresh start here. Lead a normal life and have babies.
26;2;Princess;Can we? Can we really move here and finally have our privacy?
26;2;Prince;My love, I will do anything for your privacy.
26;2;;The next day. The Prince and Princess of Canada show up to the neighborhood in an airplane, and they get off with all their belongings in boxes. They seem to have bought the old Cartman residency. Movers begin making their way inside with all the Prince's and Princess's furniture.
26;2;Prince;The couch goes in the first room! Ay, be careful with that TV, buddy! Drum set goes on the second floor. [Kyle opens his front door to see what is happening] Wait, put it down. I want to make sure it isn't damaged.
26;2;Kyle;What the hell?
26;2;Prince;[He plays his drumset, very loudly, until he sees Kyle] Hey! Hey, you! Hey, what are you looking at?! You ever heard of privacy?!
26;2;Kyle;What?
26;2;;South Park Elementary. Cartman, Stan, Kenny, Tolkien and Jimmy are hanging out by the lockers, and kyle walks in.
26;2;Kyle;You guys, I am so sorry. I totally was going to play with you guys online but the Prince of Canada and his wife moved in across the street from me. They have this huge jet parked in front of my house and then they kept trying to get me to buy their stupid book and -- and, anyway, I'm sorry I messed up another game night.
26;2;Stan;It's okay, dude, we had a great time.
26;2;Cartman;Yeah, we are literally dripping with drip.
26;2;Kyle;Well, I just want you guys to know that I am a reliable, fun-loving, punctual victim.
26;2;Stan;...'Kay, well, we gotta get to class.[They all start leaving]
26;2;Kyle;I'm really working on myself! You're gonna like what you see! [His smile drops]
26;2;;A slideshow plays, as Mr. Davis begins to talk.
26;2;Mr. Davis;As a child, you see the world in a different way. You see the wonder in nature, and you're starting to learn more about yourself, all the time. And you're learning that there's something more important than you ever thought -- your brand. It's what defines you. And with brand management, you can make sure others see you the way they want to see you.
26;2;;The scene transitions to Mr. Davis at the CumHammer Brand Management office.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Welcome to your CumHammer Work tutorial. You are taking the first steps to making your brand a great one.
26;2;;The scene then cuts to Kyle's bedroom, watching the CumHammer Work tutorial and taking notes.
26;2;Mr. Davis;[through the tablet] By now you've received your workbook and also your brand slide tool and CumHammer social-media drive which will be used in this video. Now, if you're ready, let's start the exercises on page five of your workbook.
26;2;;Suddenly, fireworks begin going off outside of Kyle's house. Kyle goes to his window and sees the Prince and Princess of Canada igniting fireworks, while laughing hysterically.
26;2;Prince;Respect our privacy!
26;2;Princess;Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
26;2;Prince and Princess;Down with the monarchy! We just want our privacy!
26;2;;Kyle sees all of this go down, and gets furious.
26;2;Kyle;God, fuck these people!
26;2;Princess;Why are we so mad today?
26;2;Prince;Because we want our privacy!
26;2;;Park County Police Department. A police officer answers an incoming call.
26;2;Officer;Park County Police Station. What's your emergency?
26;2;Kyle;Yeah, the neighbors across the steet are setting off fireworks and it's 10:30 at night!
26;2;Officer;Oh, is it the Prince of Canada and his wife, who just want to be left alone?
26;2;Kyle;Yes. They're being super loud, and I'm trying to work on my brand! [he checks his window] Oh, god damn it. Now, the Prince is playing polo on the lawn![The Prince is shown playing polo, continuing to be very loud along with his wife.]
26;2;Princess;We are here because privacy is a basic human right. How many more princes and his wives have to live in this nightmare?
26;2;;The Prince hits the ball and smashes Kyle's bedroom window.
26;2;Kyle;Hey, can you two fucking keep it down?!
26;2;Prince;"Oy! You ever heard of a thing called ""privacy""?!"
26;2;Kyle;Yeah, nobody gives a shit! Will you two just shut up, and go away?! [Another ball hits Kyle's window, smashing it.]
26;2;;South Park Elementary. The cafeteria. The boys are eating their lunch, as Kyle begins to rant about last night.
26;2;Kyle;It seriously is driving me crazy! The prince plays drums all day. I don't think he even has a job. And I don't know what the hell she does. Why they even left Canada is beyond me. And, like, she seems to just boss him around, and make him do whatever she wants. I mean, why did they even leave Canada and move to South Park, anyway?
26;2;Cartman;Stan, are you gonna say something?
26;2;Stan;You say it.
26;2;Kyle;Say what?
26;2;Stan;Look, Kyle... We just kinda don't care about some dumb prince and his stupid wife.
26;2;Kyle;I don't care about them either!
26;2;Jimmy;So, then why do you talk about them all the time?
26;2;Kyle;[He stutters and isn't able to come up with anything]
26;2;Stan;Dude, we're just kind of sick of hearing about them.
26;2;Kyle;I'm sick of hearing about them! But I can't get away from them! They're everywhere! In my fucking face!
26;2;Tolkien;Yeah, and now you're putting 'em in our fucking face.
26;2;Kyle;Fine, I won't talk about them anymore.
26;2;Cartman;Thank you.
26;2;;Silence fills the cafeteria table. The boys resume eating their lunch, until Kyle speaks up again.
26;2;Kyle;Ok, just one last thing -- did you know the Prince sleeps-
26;2;;The rest of the group gets frustrated and they all leave the table, leaving Kyle alone.
26;2;Kyle;I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
26;2;;CumHammer Brand Management.
26;2;Mr. Davis;The problem with you is you want results without the work. You can't just say you're a certain thing, and then expect people to just like your brand. You gotta work it, sell people on it.
26;2;Kyle;But I just don't feel like my brand is who I really am on the inside.
26;2;Mr. Davis;You know, Kyle, some people think it's what's inside you that matters. But people can't see inside you. They can only see what kind of drink you're drinking. That's what matters.
26;2;Kyle;I guess so.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Now, I'm gonna help you with a new brand, but you've got to work on it. What do you want your friends to think about you?
26;2;Kyle;I want them to think I'm not gonna complain about things. I'm more thick-skinned.
26;2;Mr. Davis;[typing on his computer] Okay. This is good. This is good...
26;2;Kyle;And I want people to think I'm stronger, mentally, than I probably already am.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Okay. Okay. I think I got it. People are gonna love this. Kyle -- he's a thick-skinned, super cool, nothing bothers him victim.
26;2;Kyle;I just don't know if I can--
26;2;Mr. Davis;[stops Kyle] You're goin' off brand already! Remember, no matter what, nothing bothers you.
26;2;;After school. The school bus drops off Kyle and Kenny, and Kyle makes his way back home. When he arrives, he sees magazine covers of the Princess of Canada plastered all over his door. The Prince and the Princess peek over their window. Kyle almost gets upset, but stops himself from doing so.
26;2;Kyle;I don't care. Don't care. [he goes inside]
26;2;Prince;What the hell?
26;2;Princess;What'd he just say? He victimized me! It's because I'm an ethnic woman!
26;2;Prince;He can't do that! I'll see -- Wait, you're ethnic? This is an outrage! We'll just see how he deals with my blue penis!
26;2;;The Prince walks over to Kyle's house window. As Kyle is playing a videogame, the Prince is pounding at the window, and then takes off his pants to reveal his blue private parts.
26;2;Prince;Hey! Have some respect for this privacy!
26;2;;Kyle ignores the Prince's antics, as he continues rubbing his privates on the window. Seeing no results, the Prince walks away disappointedly. The Prince and his wife go back into their house, feeling defeated. The Princess begins crying. The Prince holds her close for comfort.
26;2;Prince;Don't worry, my love, he's not gonna get away with this.
26;2;;South Park Elementary. A cool song begins to play as Kyle opens the front doors. He is not wearing his orange jacket, only a black t-shirt and carrying a blue folder. He walks across the hallway, overflowing with confidence. He arrives to where the rest of the boys are at, and leans an arm on the lockers.
26;2;Kyle;Hey, guys! How you doin?!
26;2;Stan;[unamused] Good. How are you?
26;2;Kyle;I'm great! Got some good sleep last night. Just letting things roll right off my back, you know? 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am.
26;2;Cartman;[also unamused] Cool.
26;2;Kyle;"Hey, you guys want to play ""Darktide"" after school? Or if not, whatever. I'm cool either way."
26;2;Stan;Yeah, I'm sure we can figure that out.
26;2;Kyle;Cool, whatever. I'm care-free and unflappable. I'll catch you guys at lunch! [he walks away, Jimmy approaches him]
26;2;Jimmy;Wow, Kyle, you seem really different.
26;2;Kyle;Do you like it?
26;2;Jimmy;Uh, sure.
26;2;Kyle;Thanks, Jimmy. But you know, I really need to thank a good friend. He introduced me to a way of becoming a more stable person. Have you seen Butters?
26;2;Jimmy;Butters? Oh, sure. He's out on the playground, getting the shit beat of out him by Bebe.
26;2;Kyle;What?!
26;2;;The school playground. Several kids are gathered around Bebe and Butters. Bebe has the upper hand, beating Butters down to a bloody pulp.
26;2;Bebe;Mother! [punches Butters] Fucker! Don't ever say that shit again!
26;2;Kyle;Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is going on?!
26;2;Bebe;I wasn't even doing anything, and he came up, and started talking shit to me!
26;2;Butters;Yeah, everyone likes a guy that's strong and assertive, so I told Bebe to go fuck herself.
26;2;Bebe;Who do you even think you are?!
26;2;Butters;You want some more of this, you dumb slut?!
26;2;Kyle;Butters, what are you doing?! This isn't you.
26;2;Butters;Hey, Kyle, will you relax? You're kind of fucking up my brand.
26;2;Kyle;Okay, that does it -- come on, Butters. You're going back to CumHammer.
26;2;Bebe;You're lucky he saved your ass!
26;2;Butters;Fuck you, you fucking bitch!
26;2;;CumHammer Brand Management.
26;2;Mr. Davis;The most important thing about your brand is being flexible. We want to make sure you're completely satisfied. You say you're having some problems?
26;2;Prince of Canada;That's right! There's this horrible spy who lives across the street from us, and we're gonna get him back by changing our brand!
26;2;Mr. Davis;All right. And I do see you're in our database, but you didn't first get help at this CumHammer location?
26;2;Prince;No. My wife went to one in California as a child.
26;2;Mr. Davis;"Ah, okay. Then you must be in the national system. Oh, yeah. Is this you? ""Sorority girl, Actress, Influencer, Victim."""
26;2;Princess;Yeah. That's totally me.
26;2;Mr. Davis;"Okay, I see. And then, you added your husband to your Friends and Family account. You must be the, ""Royal prince, millionaire, world traveler, victim."""
26;2;Prince;That's right.
26;2;;Kyle walks in with Butters, holding his hand the whole way inside.
26;2;Kyle;Come on, Butters. Hello?
26;2;Mr. Davis;Oh, hey there! Just gimme a minute. I'm with some other clients right now, there, Kyle.
26;2;Kyle;Uh, no. This is an emergency. We need to talk to --
26;2;Prince;Oy! Do you mind! Stop invading -- [gasps] It's him!
26;2;Princess;[screaming]
26;2;Kyle;What the hell are you doing here?!
26;2;Prince;You just can't leave us alone, can't you!
26;2;Princess;Oh my God, he is so obsessed with us!
26;2;Kyle;I'm not obsessed with you! It's this stupid place! Don't you see, Butters? Teaching people to think of their brand just makes people more like them. This whole thing is wrong. They're telling you guys to reduce yourselves into products instead of people to be truly understood and loved. Don't you guys want people to like you for you instead of who they want you to be? Look, we all have our faults. God knows I do. But if we just try to present and control an image of us for people to see, then, we're just performers instead of human beings.
26;2;Prince;He's right. Trying to make ourselves into a brand just turned us into products. We don't need to be a brand, do we? If it's truly what we want, then we really can get away from it all. No more magazines and Netflix shows. We really can live a normal life. [He motions to his wife, no response.] Yes, I'm sure you agree darling. We can be the people we talked about being, with no more worries about how we look or the image with project to people. What matters is what we have on the inside.
26;2;;The Prince tries to get a response from his wife, but she says nothing. He opens her mouth, hoping for a reply.
26;2;Prince;[echoing] Hello?
26;2;Kyle;Come on, Butters. Time to go home.
26;2;Butters;Yeah.
26;2;A Girl;Yeah.
26;2;A Boy;Yeah...
26;2;;Everyone in the building begins to leave.
26;2;Mr. Davis;Now, hey. Don't make a decision you might all regret.
26;2;Prince;Yeah, come on, honey. We don't need this place. [he starts leaving, and looks back to see his wife not moving at all] Honey?
26;2;;The Princess does not move an inch or acknowledge him, which makes the Prince sad as he leaves the building.
26;2;;A chruch in Canada. Once again, the funeral of the Queen is taking place. Ike watches it the funeral all over again, crying as it goes on.
26;2;Reporter;The Queen is dead. What a sad day for Canada -- and therefore, the world.
26;2;Ike;[sobbing]
26;2;Kyle;Ike, I need to use the -- Oh no, not again...
26;2;Ike;She's still dead.
26;2;Kyle;Ike, I have to get on the computer. The Queen's been dead a long time. [Ike continues to cry] Ike! I have to get on with my friends! If I don't, they're gonna think I'm...
26;2;;Kyle stops all of a sudden, reflecting on himself. Instead of fighting back, he places an arm on Ike's shoulder as a form of comfort.
26;2;Kyle;It's okay. Things get to you. It's who you are.
26;2;;Kyle leaves the room and heads downstairs to the living room. He hears a knock at the front door and he goes to open it.
26;2;Kyle;Oh. Hey, guys.
26;2;Stan;Hey, dude. Uh... We thought maybe you could do with a little outside time.
26;2;Kyle;Really?
26;2;Tolkien;We just thought it'd be good to get you out of the house. You seem to be going through a lot lately.
26;2;Kyle;Yeah. Yeah, I have. [he smiles a bit] Thanks, guys. I'd love to play.
26;2;;All the boys go down to the basketball court to play some basketball. The Prince of Canada walks in and approaches them.
26;2;Prince;Oy! Oy! Could, uh... Could I play?
26;2;Stan;Sure, you can play.
26;2;Prince;Great!
26;2;;He rushes to get his drums, and begins to play as the boys continue their basketball game.
