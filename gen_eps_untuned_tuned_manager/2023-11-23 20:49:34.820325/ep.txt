plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Cartman's house. Cartman disagrees and thinks they should be eaten.
kyle: Cartman, how could you even suggest something so cruel and heartless? These calves deserve a chance at life, not to end up as someone's dinner. We have to do something to help them.
cartman: Eric Cartman: Oh, boo-hoo, Kyle! Why are you always such a bleeding heart? Those calves are just gonna end up as a tasty meal anyway, so we might as well enjoy some veal. Besides, do you have any idea how expensive it is to take care of animals? We can make a profit from selling their meat!
kyle: kyle: Cartman, you're missing the point! Just because it's profitable doesn't mean it's right. These calves deserve to live, not be turned into a profit. We can't just stand by and let this happen. We have to do something to save them.
