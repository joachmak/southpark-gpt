plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Butters is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
stan: Stan: Butters, I support your idea of saving the calves, but I don't think bringing them to my house is the best plan. We need to figure out a way to help them without causing more problems.
butters: Butters: Aw, gee whiz, fellas, I just can't bear the thought of those poor baby calves becoming veal. But, I suppose you're right, Stan. We gotta come up with a better plan to keep them safe. I just wanna make sure they're okay, you know?
