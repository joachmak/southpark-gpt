plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. Kyle is horrified, and decides to save the calves from becoming veal. Kyle wants to rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. The parents of Kyle disagree.
kyle: Kyle: "But you guys, can't you see how wrong it is? These calves deserve a chance to live their lives, not end up as someone's dinner. We have to do something!"
cartman: Eric: Oh my God, Kyle, nobody cares about your stupid vegan agenda. I just want to eat a juicy burger, okay? So, shut up and let's enjoy the damn field trip!
kyle: Kyle: "This isn't about some stupid agenda, Cartman! These calves are being treated unfairly, and we need to do something about it. I won't just stand by and let them be turned into veal, no matter what anyone says!"
cartman: Eric: Ugh, Kyle, always with your bleeding heart crap. Fine, do whatever you want, but don't come crying to me when those calves start chewing on your mom's garden or crapping all over Stan's house.
kyle: Kyle: "I don't care, Cartman! I'm not letting these calves suffer just because it's inconvenient. We have to save them, no matter what. And I'll make sure they don't wreak havoc, but we can't let them be turned into veal. It's just not right."
cartman: Eric: Ugh, fine, whatever, Kyle! But if those damn calves end up causing any trouble, I'm not gonna lift a finger to help. And don't expect me to babysit them or anything, you got that?
