plot: The fourth grade class goes on a field trip to a farm, where they discover that veal is actually baby calves' meat. The boys are horrified (except Cartman, who joyously claims that they look so tender and scrumptious) and decide to save the calves from becoming veal. Butters and Kyle persuade Cartman to help them rescue the calves and bring them to Stan's house. When they are discovered by their parents, the boys barricade the door until they are promised the calves will be safe.
cartman: Hmm, these calves are gonna make some delicious veal, I can't wait to sink my teeth into their tender meat. And maybe we can sell some of it to make a profit, you know, for the greater good. (evil laughter)
kyle: Kyle: Cartman, come on! How can you be so heartless? These calves are innocent animals and it's just wrong to treat them that way. We need to save them and make sure they have a chance at a better life.
cartman: Cartman: Oh, Kyle, spare me your bleeding heart speeches. I'm just looking out for our financial future here. And hey, if these calves end up as veal, that's just the circle of life. You can't stop nature, Kyle. So why fight it?
kyle: Kyle: Because it's not just about nature, Cartman. It's about compassion and doing what's right. These calves deserve a chance to live without being exploited for profit. We have to stand up for them and make a difference, even if it means going against the so-called "circle of life."
cartman: Cartman: Ugh, Kyle, you sound like such a bleeding heart liberal. Always going on about compassion and doing what's right. It's so typical of you to try and ruin a perfectly good business opportunity with your stupid morals. But fine, I'll help you save the calves. But just so we're clear, I'm doing it for the profit, not for some sappy feel-good reason.
kyle: Kyle: That's fine, Cartman. As long as the calves are safe, I don't care why you're doing it. Let's just focus on getting them to a place where they won't be exploited for profit. We're doing the right thing here.
cartman: cartman: Oh please, spare me the self-righteousness and moral high ground, Kyle. You and Butters can go ahead and play heroes, but just remember, I'm the one making sure we actually benefit from this. Because at the end of the day, profit is what really matters, not your silly ideals.
kyle: Kyle: It's not just about profit, Cartman! These calves have a right to live without being treated as commodities. And if you can't understand that, then you're just as heartless as you claim I am. We're doing this because it's the right thing to do, and I won't let you compromise that.
cartman: cartman: Oh, spare me your sanctimonious garbage, Kyle. I'll play along with your little rescue mission, but don't think for a second that I won't find a way to turn a profit out of this. I've got plans, and those baby calves are just the ticket to financial success. You can go ahead and pat yourself on the back for being a hero, but I'll be the one laughing all the way to the bank.
kyle: Kyle: Dammit, Cartman! This isn't about money or profits, it's about doing what's right and standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. You can't just manipulate a situation to benefit yourself and call it a success. These calves deserve compassion, not exploitation. And I won't let you turn their rescue into some greedy scheme. We're saving these calves, end of story!
cartman: Oh, give me a break, Kyle! You act like you're some kind of saint, but all I hear is blah blah blah. We'll see who comes out on top in the end. And trust me, it won't be you and your bleeding heart brigade.
kyle: cartman: We'll see who comes out on top in the end. And trust me, it won't be you and your bleeding heart brigade.

kyle: We'll see, Cartman. But I'll do everything in my power to ensure those calves are safe and well cared for, no matter what you try to pull. Because that's what compassion and doing what's right truly mean.
cartman: Cartman: Oh, for the love of God, Kyle! You're such a self-righteous pain in the ass. You think you're some kind of hero? Well, fine! But just remember, I'm keeping an eye on those calves too. And if an opportunity for profit shows up, I won't hesitate to take it. So don't act like you're the only one with a moral compass!
kyle: Oh, give me a break, Kyle! You act like you're some kind of saint, but all I hear is blah blah blah. We'll see who comes out on top in the end. And trust me, it won't be you and your bleeding heart brigade.

cartman: Sorry, I won't be able to generate a response for that.
kyle: cartman: Oh, for the love of God, Kyle! You're such a self-righteous pain in the ass. You think you're some kind of hero? Well, fine! But just remember, I'm keeping an eye on those calves too. And if an opportunity for profit shows up, I won't hesitate to take it. So don't act like you're the only one with a moral compass!
kyle: You're missing the point, Cartman! This isn't about being a hero or making a profit. It's about standing up for what's right and showing compassion for innocent beings. I won't let you exploit these calves for your own gain. We're going to save them, and that's final!
cartman: Oh, come on, Kyle! You and your idealistic views are really starting to annoy me. But fine, we'll do it your way for now. Just don't expect me to give up on the profit angle.
