plot: the boys are trying to find out who ate the last kfc chicken nugget. Cartman blames butters, but butters is innocent and cute. Kyle is jewish so he cannot eat chicken?
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Yeah, yeah, blame the innocent, cute ones, right? Classic move, Kyle. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you can't eat chicken, you paranoid little crybaby."
kyle: Kyle: "I'm not being paranoid, you moron! And being Jewish does mean I don't eat certain foods, including non-kosher meat like chicken nuggets. Butters is innocent, and I won't let you blame him for something he didn't do!"
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Oh please, Kyle! Like anyone even cares about your dietary restrictions. And Butters is always the innocent one, it's the perfect cover! Now who's being the moron, huh?"
kyle: Kyle: "Just because you don't care about my dietary restrictions doesn't mean they aren't important, Cartman. And maybe if you didn't eat everyone else's food, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place!"
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Oh, cry me a river, Kyle! I can't help it if I have a healthy appetite. And let's not forget, you guys owe me for all the times I've shared my food with you. So how about we just drop this whole stupid nugget thing and go get some more KFC?"
kyle: Kyle: "No, we're not dropping this, Cartman! You can't just bully your way out of this like you always do. We need to find out who really ate the last nugget and Butters is innocent. We can't let you get away with blaming him just because you're too selfish to admit the truth!"
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Selfish? Me? Oh, come on, Kyle! You're just jealous that I have the guts to do whatever it takes to get what I want. And Butters is definitely not as innocent as he looks. I've seen him sneaking around with those chicken nuggets before. You're just too blind to see it!"
kyle: Kyle: "I'm not blind, Cartman! You're just too stubborn to see the truth! And I am not jealous of your so-called 'guts,' I'm disgusted by your lack of integrity and empathy. And Butters is innocent, whether you like it or not!"
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Oh, spare me the righteous act, Kyle! You're just upset because you know I'm right. Butters is not as innocent as you think, and I won't rest until I prove it. And if you all want KFC so bad, I suggest you start looking for the nugget thief instead of wasting your time on me!"
kyle: Kyle: "Fine, we will find the truth, Cartman. Butters is innocent and I won't stand by while you unfairly accuse him. We're going to solve this and clear Butters' name, no matter what it takes."
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Yeah, yeah, go ahead and waste your time. Butters may have you all wrapped around his little finger, but I'll be the one laughing when the truth comes out. It's only a matter of time before Butters shows his true colors, and then you'll all see who's right."
kyle: Kyle: "We'll see who's right, Cartman. I won't let you manipulate us or bully Butters. He's not just some pawn in your selfish games. We'll prove his innocence, and you'll have to face the consequences of your lies."
cartman:  Eric Cartman: "Ugh, whatever, Kyle. You're all just a bunch of gullible idiots. But fine, let's see who comes out on top. I'll be waiting for your little 'truth' to come out, and when it does, you'll all regret doubting me."
kyle: Kyle: "We won't regret anything, Cartman. You're the one who will regret underestimating us. We'll uncover the truth and then you'll see that Butters is innocent. You can't manipulate us forever, Cartman!"
cartman: Eric Cartman: "Oh, cry me a river, Kyle! You're all so delusional if you think you can outsmart me. Butters is not as innocent as you think, and I won't rest until I prove it. And when I do, you'll all be begging for my forgiveness."
kyle: Kyle: "I'm not begging for anything, Cartman. We'll find the truth, and when we do, you'll have to apologize for falsely accusing Butters. I won't let you get away with twisting the facts to suit your own selfish desires. Just wait and see, Cartman."
