plot: The kids of South Park agree to ignore Cartman, leading him to think that he is dead.
cartman: (Scene: The playground in South Park. The kids are gathered in a circle, whispering and giggling amongst themselves, while Cartman stands off to the side, scowling.)

Cartman: (crossing his arms) Fine, you all think you're so clever, don't you?! Ignoring me won't make me disappear, you know! I'm not dead, you idiots! You can't just get rid of Cartman that easily!

(Kyle smirks, unable to resist the opportunity to taunt Cartman.)

Kyle: Oh, I don't know, Cartman. The silence is pretty deafening. Maybe we should hold a memorial service for you?

Cartman: (seething with anger) Shut up, Kyle, you dumb Jew! You think you're better than me just because you're the only one who talks to God? Well, let me tell you something, chosen one. I'm gonna make you regret this!

(Butters, who is known for being easily influenced, approaches Cartman tentatively.)

Butters: Uh, hey, Eric. Maybe they didn't mean no harm. They're just tryin' somethin' different, you know?

Cartman: (snapping at Butters) Stay out of this, Butters! This doesn't concern you, you gullible little twerp!

(Stan steps forward, his voice filled with frustration.)

Stan: Look, Cartman, we're just tired of your constant insults and drama. Maybe if we ignore you, you'll learn to be a bit less of a jerk.

Cartman: (mockingly) Oh wow, Stan the hero, standing up for everyone's feelings now? How noble of you! Newsflash, you pathetic bunch of losers, you can't ignore me forever! I am the almighty Cartman, and I will make you bow down to me once again!

(Kenny, who usually mumbles unintelligibly, butts in, raising an eyebrow skeptically.)

Kenny: (muffled) Mmm, mmmfff mmm?

Cartman: (rolling his eyes) No, Kenny, I don't think dying my hair pink will get their attention. I need something bigger, something... unforgettable!

(Cartman storms off, leaving the kids behind, whispering and wondering what Cartman has in store for them.)
